# 1. Introduction to *Cloud Computing*.

#### Cloud Computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.

#  2. Features of *Cloud Computing* .
#### Cloud Computing is perhaps the most useful technological innovation of the 21st century. This is because it has seen the fastest adoption into the mainstream than any other technology in the domain. This adoption has been fueled mainly by the ever-increasing number of smartphones and mobile devices that can access the internet. Cloud computing is not just for organizations and businesses it’s also useful for the average person as well. It enables us to run software programs without installing them on our computers it enables us to store and access our multimedia content via the internet, It enables us to develop and test programs without necessarily having servers and so on. Cloud computing is a 21st-century marvel that holds its importance in almost every field you can think of.

# 3.Introduction to github and benefits of using github.
#### GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. The service is able to do this by using git, a revision control system that runs in the command line interface.
#### Benefits of using Github:

•GitHub provides developers and researchers with a dynamic and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion.

•GitHub is a very versatile tool to use. It is ideal for working on projects of any size and it is an amazing tool for web workflows.

# 4.Basics of Markdown language .
#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. 

# 5.Importance of technical documentation .
#### Importance of technical documentation Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.

 > Features of **Github**
 - Repository.
 - Star.
- Watch.
- Forking.
-  Pull request and Merge.
 
 ### Repository:
- A repository is like a folder for your project.
- Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's history. 
- You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. 

### Star:
 - People can star other repositories as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repositories later.
### Watch:
 - You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and changes that are created.
### Forking:
 - Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
 - This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 

### Pull request and Merge:
 - If you want to make any changes, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner of the repository.
 - That user can then, merge the changes in the original repository.

  ## 1. Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing.
  ## 2. Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).
  
 # Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing:
 Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.
Cloud disaster recovery (cloud DR) is a combination of strategies and services intended to back up data, applications and other resources to public cloud or dedicated service providers. When disaster occurs, the affected data, applications and other resources can be restored to the local data center or a cloud provider and resume normal operation for the enterprise.

#  Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).

## Capital Expenditure(CapEx) :
CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments by the firm. Making capital expenditures on fixed assets can include everything from repairing a roof to building, to purchasing a piece of equipment, to building a brand new factory. This type of financial outlay is also made by companies to maintain or increase the scope of their operations.

##  Operational Expenditure(OpEx):
Operational expenditure consists of those expenses that a business incurs to run smoothly every single day. They are the costs that a business incurs while in the process of turning its inventory into an end product. Hence, depreciation of fixed assets that are used in the production process is considered OpEx expenditure. OpEx is also known as an operating expenditure, revenue expenditure or an operating expense.

## Cloud deployment models :
### Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud.
### It is a cloud-based infrastructure used by stand-alone organizations. It offers greater control over security. The data is backed up by a firewall and internally, and can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements, high management demands, and availability requirements.

- ### Private Cloud
- ### Public Cloud
- ### Community Cloud
- ### Hybrid Cloud

##  Cloud Deployment Services :
- ###  IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- ###  PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- ###  SaaS (Software as a Service)

> Today I learn about AWS((Amazon Web Services):
# AWS (Amazon Web Services):
 
- ### AWS, a subordinate of Amazon, is a platform that offers comprehensive, on demand, secure cloud services to individuals and organizations to build, enhance and promote business applications.

- ### Amazon Web Services cloud provides an extensive package of very useful services which, when collaborate and work with each other, produce highly dynamic applications.
## Benefits of using AWS :
- ## Zero CapEx
Many people tend to believe that AWS or any other cloud-based solution are only for the riches. However, the reality is completely opposite. We see AWS as playing field leveler enabling start-ups to leverage high-end technologies and infrastructure needs with ZERO CapEx. 

- ## No-Commitment :
Whether you require a server for hosting a small website, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for heavy traffic sites, reliable & scalable email service, data warehousing service,  or Hadoop cluster for your BigData needs, AWS offers everything with absolutely no-commitment at all, not even a month. All server-backed services are charged on hourly basis, so as soon as you terminate/stop a server, you won’t be billed from next hour.
 - ##  Get Rid of Negotiations :
 Surely price negotiations is not an expertise area for many (atleast me) and neither we like spending our time & energy doing that even if we have the skills. AWS is highly focused on reducing infrastructure cost for their customers.
 -  ## Procurement:
 Procuring a new server might take time between several hours to 8-10 days depending upon whether your infrastructure is on-premise, co-located or if you are associated with a hosting provider. Similar time is needed to procure software licenses as well. However, AWS enables you to spin-up new servers within few minutes with no need to buy separate licenses for many operating systems & softwares.
 - ## Pay Per Use
 Think of infinite space for your backup & archival needs, ability to launch new servers, up-scale or downscale a server, CDN integration, transcoding media files, unlimited bandwidth and many more highly scalable services or features available to you while you pay based on your actual usage only.
 - ##  Security:
 AWS has build world class, highly secure infrastructure, both physically and over the internet.
 - ## Flexibility:
 Forget about guess-work or scientific analysis to identify your infrastructure needs. You can leverage auto-scaling to build a self-managing infrastructure aligned closely to the actual need based on traffic/resources utilization. Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) enable you to spin-up clones in multiple regions for different environments within few minutes, eliminating the need to repeat the set-up steps every time.
 - ## Global Leader :
 Amazon has global presence with 10 regions, 36 availability zones and more than 50 edge locations. Few months ago, Gartner positioned AWS in Leaders Quadrant of the new Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service. Gartner also mentioned that AWS has more than five times the compute capacity in use than the aggregate total of rest 14 service providers placed in the same Magic Quadrant.

> Today I learn about Microsoft azure.
# Microsoft Azure :

- Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.
- Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.

# Working of microsoft azure :
- Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VM) and databases.
- In addition to the services that Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure. The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but may involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.
## List of Top Azure Services

 - Azure DevOps
 - Virtual Machines
 - Azure Cosmos DB
 - Azure Active Directory
 - API Management
 - Azure Content Delivery Network
 - Azure Backup
 - Logic Apps
     
  ## list of bebefits of microsoft azure :   
   - Apps management
   - Flexibility
   - Agility
   - Compliance
   - Storage
   - Security
   - Analytics Support
   - Unified Delivery Plan

 # cloud region :
## The simplest explanation is that a “cloud region” describes the actual, real-life geographic location where your public cloud resources are located.

# Why are regions important?
- ### Regions allow you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers, both internal or external. The closer your customers are to the region where your cloud resources are located, the faster and better their experience will be. For example, if your customers are located in Germany, it makes sense to choose a European region for your cloud region, even if your office is in Delaware.
- ### Regions are also commonly used as part of disaster recovery (DR) strategy. While many public cloud users depend on the reliability and redundancy of inter-region resources for DR, some use multiple regions to achieve the same result. Sometimes this is required for regulatory or compliance reasons, but sometimes it’s simply company policy.
## Date: May 24, 2020
 ## What is Azure Region Pairs?

- #### Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, and this makes a regional pair except for Brazil South, which is paired with a region outside its geography.

- #### Among these regional pairs or Azure Region Pairs, only one paired region is updated at a time. The Azure Region pairs offer multiple benefits. These regional pairs are always located greater than 300 miles apart. These Azure Region pairs are directly connected and are far enough alone to be isolated from regional disasters so that the disaster affects only one region.
 - ## Why pairing?

- #### Suppose, if one of the regions were to experience a disaster, then the services of the primary region will automatically failovers to the secondary region of that regional pair. For example— East Asia region’s pair is Southeast Asia.

- #### These Azure Regions are paired together, within the same geographic regions, for retrieving our data even after the experience of disaster, and also for the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) purpose.

## Benefits of paired regions
### 1. Physical isolation

- Each Azure region within a pair is located at least 300 miles apart. This helps in isolation of the pairs so that the regional disaster affects only one region within that pair.

### 2. Platform-provided replication

- There are some services within Microsoft Azure such as Geo-Redundant Storage that provides automatic replication to the paired region.

### 3. Region recovery order

- For maximum disaster recovery, one region out of every pair is prioritized for recovery Out of every pair, the recovery of one region is prioritized.
### 4. Data residency

- A region resides within the same geography for the data residency requirements for tax and judiciary purposes.
### 5. Sequential updates

- To minimize the downtime, the paired regions are sequentially updated.

#  Fault domain :
####  Two events Unplanned Hardware maintenance Event and Unexpected Downtime comes under the fault domain.
 #### A fault domain is factually a rack of the servers which consumes mostly subsystem like network, power, cooling, etc. When you put VMs on an Availability Set, then to protect VMs from failure, Azure spread them on fault domain and update domain.
 
 
## Date: May 26, 2020 
 ## Service Level Agreements (SLA)
- Some of the web hosting companies offer a Service Level Agreement. It states the guaranteed level of availability. If the web host doesn’t deliver that uptime level, you will be entitled to refunds or hosting credits.
 
 ## Cloud uptime :
- #### Cloud uptime is the amount of time that a cloud service hosted by a cloud provider is accessible to end users.
-  When negotiating cloud uptime in a cloud storage service-level agreement (cloud storage SLA), organizations  evaluate the following items: 
   -  How fast will the system work when it is up and running? (This is also known as a response time warranty.)
   - What is the guaranteed uptime percentage? 
   - What timeframe is the vendor using for its uptime guarantee? (Some providers may base their uptime on an annual basis instead of a monthly one.
- ## Understanding Downtime :
 - Downtime is generally viewed as any time that a system or service is not working. Companies do everything they can to 
  maximize uptime.

#  Scaling in cloud computing :
 - Scaling is defined as the ability for an IT resource to handle growing or decreasing demands in a capable manner. It is one of the most popular and beneficial features of cloud computing, as businesses can scale up or down to meet demands based on season, projects, growth and more. By implementing cloud scalability, you enable your resources to grow as your traffic or organization grows, and vice versa. There are a few main ways to scale in the cloud.
 # Vertical Scaling
- Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to your server (database or application server is still remains one) as on demand. Vertical Scaling is most commonly used in applications and products of middle-range as well as small and middle-sized companies.
# Horizontal scaling :
- Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling. This method tends to take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together, handle traffic efficiently and execute concurrent workloads.

# What is a container ?
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
- For those coming from virtualized environments, containers are often compared with virtual machines (VMs). You might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with virtualized access to the underlying hardware. Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments for running your software services. 

## Benefits of containers :

- ### Consistent Environment
Containers give developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from other applications. Containers can also include software dependencies needed by the application, such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and other software libraries. From the developer’s perspective, all this is guaranteed to be consistent no matter where the application is ultimately deployed. 

- ### Run Anywhere
Containers are able to run virtually anywhere, greatly easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems ,on virtual machines or bare metal, on a developer’s machine or in data centers on-premises, and of course, in the public cloud. The widespread popularity of the Docker image format for containers further helps with portability. Wherever you want to run your software, you can use containers. 

- ### Isolation
Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the OS-level, providing developers with a sandboxed view of the OS logically isolated from other applications. 

## examples of containers :
## Docker :
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines. 
## Mesos Containerizer
In 2018, 4 percent of production containers were Mesos. Developed by Apache, Mesos offers quality performance, supporting both Docker and appc image types. OCI support is likely coming, with indications they will follow Docker’s adoption trajectory.
## containerd :
containerd is described as “an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability.” An incubating project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, containerd is available as a daemon for Linux or Windows.
## CoreOS rkt
In 2018, 12 percent of production containers were rkt (pronounced “Rocket”). Rkt supports two types of images: Docker and appc. A selling point of rkt is its pod-based process that works out of the box with Kubernetes (also referred to as “rktnetes”). In Kubernetes, an rkt container runtime can easily be specified.

# What is serverless computing?

- Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A Serverless architecture allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling. Note that although called serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them.
- In the early days of the web, anyone who wanted to build a web application had to own the physical hardware required to run a server, which is a cumbersome and expensive undertaking.

- Then came the cloud, where fixed numbers of servers or amounts of server space could be rented remotely. Developers and companies who rent these fixed units of server space generally over-purchase to ensure that a spike in traffic or activity wouldn’t exceed their monthly limits and break their applications. This meant that much of the server space that was paid for usually went to waste. Cloud vendors have introduced auto-scaling models to address the issue, but even with auto-scaling an unwanted spike in activity, such as a DDoS Attack, could end up being very expensive.

## Cost benefit of serverless : 
- Serverless computing allows developers to purchase backend services on a flexible ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis, meaning that developers only have to pay for the services they use. This is like switching from a cell phone data plan with a monthly fixed limit, to one that only charges for each byte of data that actually gets used.

- The term ‘serverless’ is somewhat misleading, as there are still servers providing these backend services, but all of the server space and infrastructure concerns are handled by the vendor. Serverless means that the developers can do their work without having to worry about servers at all.


## Key Characteristics of serveless computing :
- ### 1. No Server management : 
There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer.
- ### 2. Flexible Event-driven scaling : 
This is one of the important characteristics of Serverless, you shouldn’t worry about scaling your solution if demand arises. Typically your solution will scale based on events, timer or incoming actions. Examples: Execute code every 1 second, Execute code when an  HTTP web endpoint is called, Execute code when a new file is uploaded to a blob storage or some of the simple use cases.
- ### 3. Highly available : 
Serverless applications have built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don’t need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.
- ### 4. No idle capacity :
You don’t have to pay for idle capacity. If your code is not running, you shouldn’t pay for it.
- ###  5. Micro Billing :
When your code is executed you pay per execution. Typically the vendors calculate this based on memory consumption and time it takes for execution. ex: if your code requires 200mb of RAM and it takes 3 seconds to complete, you will only need to pay for this resource.
