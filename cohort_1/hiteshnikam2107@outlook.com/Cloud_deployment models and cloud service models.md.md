> # Cloud deployment models :
## Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud computing are as follows:

# Private Cloud:
It is a cloud-based infrastructure used by stand-alone organizations. It offers greater control over security. The data is backed up by a firewall and internally, and can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements, high management demands, and availability requirements.

# Public Cloud:
This type of cloud services is provided on a network for public use. Customers have no control over the location of the infrastructure. It is based on a shared cost model for all the users, or in the form of a licensing policy such as pay per user. Public deployment models in the cloud are perfect for organizations with growing and fluctuating demands. It is also popular among businesses of all sizes for their web applications, webmail, and storage of non-sensitive data.

# Community Cloud:
It is a mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular community such as banks, government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security. This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted internally or by a third-party vendor.

# Hybrid Cloud:
This model incorporates the best of both private and public clouds, but each can remain as separate entities. Further, as part of this deployment of cloud computing model, the internal, or external providers can provide resources. A hybrid cloud is ideal for scalability, flexibility, and security. A perfect example of this scenario would be that of an organization who uses the private cloud to secure their data and interacts with its customers using the public cloud.

> Cloud Deployment Services :
# 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
# 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
# 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
 
 - ## Any Virtual machine comprises of three things, i.e. infrastructure(the actual hardware), the platform( the operating system) which will work on the infrastructure and the software which will work on the hardware and the operating system
- ## A user has to sort his requirements according to these three categories.
- ## He has to figure what infrastructure he will need, what operating system and what softwares he'd require.
- ## Various cloud providers provide different services which are mentioned down.

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure is the actual hardware of any machine.
- Instead of purchasing hardware outright, users pay for IaaS on demand.
- Infrastructure is scalable depending on processing and storage needs.

- Saves enterprises the costs of buying and maintaining their own hardware.

- Because data is on the cloud, there can be no single point of failure.

- Enables the virtualization of administrative tasks, freeing up time for other work.

- #### example of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) providers:
 - amazon web services
 - Microsoft Azure
 
## PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a service that looks for the infrastructure and the platform that the consumer wants.

- Only thing that the consumer has to look for is the software he needs.

-  PaaS provides a platform with tools to test, develop and host applications in the same environment.

- Enables organizations to focus on development without having to worry about underlying infrastructure.

 - Providers manage security, operating systems, server software and backups.

 - Facilitates collaborative work even if teams work remotely.


#### example of PaaS (Platform as a Service) providers:

- Google cloud platform.
- Microsoft Azure

## SaaS (Software as a Service):
- SaaS vendors provide users with software and applications via a subscription model.
- Users do not have to manage, install or upgrade software; SaaS providers manage this.

- Data is secure in the cloud; equipment failure does not result in loss of data.

- Use of resources can be scaled depending on service needs.

- Applications are accessible from almost any internet-connected device, from virtually anywhere in the world.
#### example of  SaaS (Software as a Service) providers:
- Microsoft Azure 
- Oracle
