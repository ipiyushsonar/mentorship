# BENEFITS OF CLOUD COMPUTING :
## >  Cost Saving :
 Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. 
 Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. 
 #### Example
 Consider, in my office I hired 5 high-end designers for designing.
 If I wish to provide 5 computers with the latest processor and latest model it consumes near about 5 lakhs for this purpose. 
 After buying these computers I don't have an idea about how much profit I gain through these computers. Instead of buying these expensive computers if I buy an i3 version or computers with less RAM,hard-disk, and processors. And I  buy 5 virtual machine  IP address for these 5 computers on rent for designing purpose.
 Hence I reduced the cost through these.
 
 ## > Security :
 In the ever-increasing era of data breaches, a top cloud computing security solution has security protocols in place to protect sensitive information and transactions. 
 This prevents a third party from eavesdropping or tampering with data being transmitted.
 
 ## > Flexibility :
 Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices.
