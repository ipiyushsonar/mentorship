#  Cloud deployment models 
#### A cloud deployment model is defined according to where the infrastructure for the deployment resides and who has control over that infrastructure.
Each cloud deployment model satisfies different organizational needs, so itâ€™s important that you choose a model that will satisfy the needs of your organization. 

Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud computing are as follows:
- ### Public cloud 
As the name suggests, this type of cloud deployment model supports all users who want to make use of a computing resource, such as hardware (OS, CPU, memory, storage) or software (application server, database) on a subscription basis. Most common uses of public clouds are for application development and testing, non-mission-critical tasks such as file-sharing, and e-mail service.
- ### Private cloud
True to its name, a private cloud is typically infrastructure used by a single organization. Such infrastructure may be managed by the organization itself to support various user groups, or it could be managed by a service provider that takes care of it either on-site or off-site. Private clouds are more expensive than public clouds due to the capital expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining them. However, private clouds are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today.
- ### Hybrid cloud
In a hybrid cloud, an organization makes use of interconnected private and public cloud infrastructure. Many organizations make use of this model when they need to scale up their IT infrastructure rapidly, such as when leveraging public clouds to supplement the capacity available within a private cloud. For example, if an online retailer needs more computing resources to run its Web applications during the holiday season it may attain those resources via public clouds.
- ### Community cloud
This deployment model supports multiple organizations sharing computing resources that are part of a community; examples include universities cooperating in certain areas of research, or police departments within a county or state sharing computing resources. Access to a community cloud environment is typically restricted to the members of the community.

##### *With public clouds, the cost is typically low for the end user and there is no capital expenditure involved.* 

##### *Use of private clouds involves capital expenditure, but the expenditure is still lower than the cost of owning and operating the infrastructure due to private clouds' greater level of consolidation and resource pooling.*

##### *Private clouds also offer more security and compliance support than public clouds. As such, some organizations may choose to use private clouds for their more mission-critical, secure applications and public clouds for basic tasks such as application development and testing environments, and e-mail services.*
