# 'VIRTUAL MACHINE'
### A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system.Software called a hypervisor separates the machineâ€™s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM. 
## How do VMs work?
#### Virtualization technology allows you to share a system with many virtual environments. The hypervisor manages the hardware and separates the physical resources from the virtual environments. Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the VMs.

## Why use VMs?
#### Most operating system and application deployments only use a small amount of the physical resources available when deployed to bare metal. By virtualizing your servers, you can place many virtual servers onto each physical server to improve hardware utilization.This keeps you from needing to purchase additional physical resources, like hard drives or hard disks, as well as reducing the need for power, space, and cooling in the datacenter. VMs provide additional disaster recovery options by enabling failover and redundancy that could previously only be achieved through additional hardware.

## Advantages Of Virtual Machine :
 - #### Multiple OS environments can exist simultaneously on the same machine, isolated from each other.
 - #### Virtual machine can offer an instruction set architecture that differs from real computers.
 - #### Easy maintenance, application provisioning, availability and convenient recovery.
 
 ## Disadvantages Of Virtual Machine :
 - #### When multiple virtual machines are simultaneously running on a host computer, each virtual machine may introduce an unstable performance, which depends on the workload on the system by other running virtual machines.
 - #### Virtual machine is not that efficient as a real one when accessing the hardware.
