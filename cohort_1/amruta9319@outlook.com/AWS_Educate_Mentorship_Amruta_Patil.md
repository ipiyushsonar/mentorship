# Amazon Web Services [AWS]
#### The AWS platform was launched in July 2002. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
#### The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary.
### In simple words AWS allows you to do the following things-
- Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.
- Securely store all your files on the cloud so you can access them from anywhere.
- Using managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server to store information.
- Deliver static and dynamic files quickly around the world using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Send bulk email to your customers.
### How AWS works
AWS is separated into different services; each can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. Users should be able to see configuration options and individual server maps for an AWS service.

More than 100 services comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio, including those for compute, databases, infrastructure management, application development and security. These services, by category, include:
- Compute
- Storage databases
- Data management
- Migration
- Hybrid cloud
- Networking
- Development tools
- Management
- Monitoring
- Security
- Governance
- Big data management
- Analytics
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Mobile development
- Messages and notification
### Benifits Of AWS
- #### Easy to use
AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS’s application hosting platform.
- #### Flexible
AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.
- #### Cost-Effective
You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.
- #### Reliable
With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade.
- #### Scalable and high-performance
Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.
- #### Secure
AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures. For more information, see the AWS Security Center.
