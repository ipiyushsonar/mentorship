 *Today I learned about Disaster Recovery.*
# Disaster Recovery
### Disaster Recovery is an important process that organisations of all sizes implement to ensure the rapid recovery of applications, data and hardware that are critical to business operations in the event of a natural disaster, network or hardware failure or human error.

 Cloud disaster recovery is a combination of strategies and services intended to back up data, applications and other resources to public cloud or dedicated service providers. When disaster occurs, the affected data, applications and other resources can be restored to the local data center or a cloud provider and resume normal operation for the enterprise.


One of the added benefits of disaster recovery with cloud computing is the ability to finely tune the costs and performance for the DR platform. Applications and servers that are deemed less critical in a disaster can be tuned down with less resources, while assuring that the most critical applications get the resources they need to keep the business running through the disaster.

## Why is Disaster Recovery so Important?
## Without your data, your business doesn’t exist.
Any type of disaster that causes a disruption in daily business operations can be devastating for a small organisation. Many studies have indicated that a high percentage of small businesses can fail permanently after significant outage or data loss.
## In today’s competitive marketplace.
*Disaster recovery is all that much more important for a small organisation. With no disaster recovery plan, you are placing your business at high risk of data and/or financial loss, reduction in customer service and retention and loss of company reputation.
When you think about it, that is a lot to sacrifice when there are numerous affordable options to help your business avoid the risks of failing to integrate a disaster recovery plan into your business continuity strategy.*
## - Human Error
*Humans make mistakes, accidentally delete data, and forget to save data before a crash occurs or overlook an important step that leads to data loss.  It happens to all of us at one point or another.
If you have a disaster recovery plan in place, you can use incremental backup technologies that ensure you can restore the data to its original state. Deploying firewalls, anti-malware and antivirus solutions is only one part of the entire security scope.*
## -  Natural Disaster
*As we all know, the weather can be very unpredictable despite the fact we have access to weather forecasts. Small businesses that have failed to plan for disaster recovery can find it nearly impossible to restore normal daily operations following a natural disaster.*
## - Hardware or Network Failure
*Hardware and network technologies are never 100 percent fool proof regardless of how modern or technologically advanced they are. What would happen if your business experiences a hardware or network outage?
Normally it would be costly to deal with the disruption and data loss. However, having a disaster recovery plan in place with an IT disaster recovery service provider, you can eliminate this risk at an affordable rate.*
