# Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.
### Here are some quick facts about Azure.
Microsoft Azure – IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
-  Flexible – Move compute resources up and down as needed
-  Open – Supports almost any OS, language, tool, or framework
-  Reliable – 99.95% availability SLA and 24×7 tech support
-  Global – Data housed in geo-synchronous data centers
-  Economical – Only pay for what you use
### How does Microsoft Azure work?
Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VM) and databases.

In addition to the services that Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure. The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but may involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.

Microsoft provides five different customer support options for Azure:- 
- Basic
- Developer
- Standard
- Professional Direct
- Premier
### Azure for Disaster Recovry and Backup
Some organizations use Azure for data backup and disaster recovery. Organizations can also use Azure as an alternative to their own data center. Rather than invest in local servers and storage, these organizations choose to run some, or all, of their business applications in Azure.
To ensure availability, Microsoft has Azure data centers located around the world. 
## Benifits of Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is the fastest growing Cloud Infrastructure Platform on the planet today.
### *Azure Business Benefits*
#### Ability to Scale on Demand :
It can be hard to predict how your business will grow, or if and when you will require extra resources for short term 'bursts' of traffic or transaction volume. Increased growth or other demands often demands running applications with high load, or additional applications that most traditional hosting models cannot handle.

So it's a big advantage that Azure was built to scale alongside your business. One way Azure does this is by loading your applications as a cluster that allocates a web application to a specific set of processes. The result is that all of your applications are not forced to run off a single server and you will thus never run out of server capacity. As a bonus, Azure can even be managed to auto scale based on load or schedule.
#### Flexibility :
In the quickly evolving technology sector you need a hosting solution that can quickly evolve as your needs change. Azure is simple to adapt and offers a host of application building blocks and services that will allow you to customise the cloud as needed.
#### Cost Competitive :
With Microsoft’s huge customer base, they have been able to pass volume discounts on to their customers. And it's a good bet that Azure costs will go down as the competition heats up with AWS and Google. Additionally, Azure works off a pay-as-you-go model, which reduces the upfront costs to small businesses and those that sign a contract can receive an additional enterprise discount. If you are worried about price increases, you can be assured they have pledged to maintain their AWS-comparable pricing for the general public.
#### Customer support :
Azure infrastructure is now in 19 regions across the globe, with multiple data center regions in the US, Europe, China, Asia and the Pacific. They provide support plans in English and Japanese and offer support plans in many more languages.
#### Hybrid Capability :
Unlike AWS’s cloud only approach, Windows Azure provides you with the ability to create hybrid environments, allowing you to leverage your on-premise resources and the benefits of the cloud without costly workarounds. With Azure you can also build hybrid applications.
### *Azure Data Benefits*
#### Big Data insights :
Microsoft Azure HDinsight service brings an Apache Hadoop solution to the cloud. While that might sound like complicated at first, the service is powerful, allowing you to handle and analyse any amount of data at a time. Additionally it integrates with Excel allowing you to visualise your data in new ways to help you uncover business insights to help you succeed. There are more and more options for BI being added regularly as the demand increases.
#### Simple and Reliable Data Storage :
Azure allows you to store any type of data, whether it is file data, structured data sets or queries in a reliable and fast environment and share it across VMs using the industry standard SMB 2.1 protocol. It’s easy to manage using an import/export feature to move data as desired.
#### Keeping your Data Secure :
Azure was built based on the the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle, a cutting edge approach for developing the most secure code based on proven technology and tested around the globe.
#### Backups you can rely on :
Azure backs up 6 copies of your data across two separate Azure data centers, which means they can guarantee 99.9% availability of backups. Azure Site Recovery is very powerful, we use it here at SaaSplaza - we use the service for our partners and customers, we haven't had to 'use' it if you know what I mean :)
#### Integrative Data Solution :
Azure seamlessly integrates data across the full line of Microsoft SaaS and PaaS offerings. This includes the Azure package such as Visual Studio, Active Directory, System Center and PowerShell, as well as Microsoft software such as Office 365 and Microsoft Dynamics solutions, Dynamics ERP (including NAV on Azure) and more. This allows you to do more with your ERP, CRM and other business data in a scalable environment that is faster and more reliable.

Not a Microsoft user? Azure’s BizTalk services provides application integration solutions for SAP, Oracle EBS and a constantly growing list of technology providers.

### *Azure Management Benefits*
#### Automation :
Azure Automation allows you to automate tasks in your Azure environment. By creating workflows called “runbooks”, you can eliminate the time spent on monitoring and maintaining the resources in your cloud environment, lowering overhead costs and allowing you to focus on value added business work.
#### API Management :
If you create and run a variety of APIs, Azure API management allows you to publish APIs to your market (employees, customers) securely and at scale.

#### "Set it and forget it" scheduling :
Microsoft Azure allows you to create jobs on simple or complex recurring schedules. If you have recurring actions such as cleaning up logs, application maintenance or pulling data from an API or feed, Azure’s scheduler can automate those tasks for you at a scheduled time. Additionally, Azure gives you the ability to create actions that call HTTP or HTTPS endpoints or post messages to a storage queue for long running or offline jobs.

Ability to Run Virtual Machines
With Azure you can deploy premium virtual machines in minutes including Linux and Windows servers. Attach premium storage to your virtual machine and begin running 32 TB and achieve 50,000 IOPS (input/output operations per second).

Developer Collaboration and Options
Azure comes with Visual Studio Online and Application Insights, which provides enhanced collaboration between your dev teams in an integrative environment. Additionally, Azure provides the option to create new applications in ASP, ASP.net, PHP, Python, or Node.js, so you are not limited to Visual Studio if you so choose.
#### What can Microsoft Azure Do?
Microsoft maintains a growing directory of Azure services, with more being added all the time. All the elements necessary to build a virtual network and deliver services or applications to a global audience are available, including:

- ##### Virtual machines:
Create Microsoft or Linux virtual machines (VMs) in just minutes from a wide selection of marketplace templates or from your own custom machine images. These cloud-based VMs will host your apps and services as if they resided in your own data center.

- ##### SQL databases:
Azure offers managed SQL relational databases, from one to an unlimited number, as a service.This saves you overhead and expenses on hardware, software, and the need for in-house expertise.
