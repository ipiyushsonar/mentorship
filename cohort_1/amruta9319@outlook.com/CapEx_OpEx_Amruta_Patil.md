# Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus Operational expenditure (OpEx)
## Capital Expenditure
A capital expenditure (CAPEX) is money that is spent to buy, repair, update, or improve a fixed company asset, such as a building, business, or equipment.
It is considered a capital expenditure when the asset is newly purchased or when money is used towards extending the useful life of an existing asset, such as repairing the roof.
### CapEx comes with many constraints, including, but not limited to:
- The physical space required for these assets,
- Their steady depreciation,
- The required – and often complex – technical setup, and
- Lengthy acquisition cycles.
- These limitations are what make cloud an appealing upgrade option in the first place. However, physical servers still have an important place for many organizations as they are being used to build their Hybrid IT and Multi-cloud strategies.

### Examples of CapEx Projects:
- Building a server farm to host business applications
- Creating a Storage Area Network to host data across applications
- Investing in new network equipment to improve performance
## Operational Expenditure
OpEx is your operating costs, the expenses to run day-to-day business, like services and consumable items that get used up and are paid for according to use. This includes printer cartridges and paper, electricity, and even yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations. These things are necessary for your business’s success but are not considered major long-term investments like CapEx items.

One of the benefits of cloud computing being an OPEX is that it doesn’t have the prohibitive upfront costs. Costs that come in building onsite IT infrastructures.

Cloud computing being an OPEX also means that you don’t have to make any long-term investments in expensive IT hardware.
