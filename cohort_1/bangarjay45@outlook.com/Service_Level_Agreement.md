> # Service Level Agreement(SLA):


1. Whenever a Cloud service user (CSU) asks for a set of particular requirements to a cloud service provider (CSP), they sign a deal, that deal is in the form of a SLA.
2. The Cloud service provider displays a number of options, like a Catalogue, to the user.
3. The User has to then choose an option that best fits his set of requirements and all the specifications, applications, hardware, charge for the services etc.
4. All the important instructions and violations and penalties about every particular section of the deal that the user and the provider approves is written in the form of a document.
5. After this document is signed, it is then known as a Service Level Agreement.
6. This Sla includes all the details about all the services that are demanded by the user and the Cloud provider has agreed to provide.
7. It is a type of contract that both parties Sign.
8. SLA's are critical component of Cloud Computing.


## **Key components of an SLA.**

### Service level parameters:
- They are the parameters/benchmarks related to the services that can be measured by the customers. The user can cross check all the parameters provided by the cloud service provider.
- Service-level parameters are used to measure the quality of the service. 
- You can ensure the quality and compliance of your business processes and applications.
  - some parameters which are mentioned below:
   1. Availability of the Service (uptime)
   2. Latency or the response time
   3. Service components reliability
   4. Each party accountability
   5. Warranties
- In any case, if a cloud service provider fails to meet the stated targets of minimums then the provider has to pay the penalty to the cloud service consumer as per the agreement.
- Service Level Agreements are like insurance policies in which the corporation has to pay as per the agreements if any casualty occurs.

### Metrics:
- They are the tools to calculate the parameters or even for testing a service.
- They are criteria negotiated between a customer and their service provider that define a definite target should be achieved for the service provided. 

### Functions and measurement directives:
- All the instructions regarding the services, the type of service, at what times, which functions, types of data involved and so on and measurements are noted in this section of a SLA.

## Why it’s important to have an SLA?

- Without service level agreement, it is not clear what will happen if one of the parties does not hold up to their end of the deal.
- For instance, we should think about that a internet supplier’s service level target is to provide a 10Mb/s bandwidth throughout the month. 
- They can without any problem say that they never guaranteed that the speed will be 10Mb/s daily if there was no SLA set up.
- Having a service level agreement takes into account precision about what the Service level targets are just as what compensation will be given targets are not met. 
- With an SLA set up, the two parties are ensured.

[**SLA for Virtual Machines**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/) 
- Last updated: January 2020

- For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones in the same Azure region, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.99% of the time.
- For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set or in the same Dedicated Host Group, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.95% of the time.
- For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%

## Limitations
This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:

- Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
- That result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;
- Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;
- During or with respect to preview, pre-release, beta or trial versions of a Service, feature or software (as determined by us) or to purchases made using Microsoft subscription credits;
- That result from your unauthorized action or lack of action when required, or from your employees, agents, contractors, or vendors, or anyone gaining access to our network by means of your passwords or equipment, or otherwise resulting from your failure to follow appropriate security practices;
- That result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service (for example, attempts to perform operations that are not supported) or inconsistent with our published guidance;
