### What is *Cloud Computing*? Why is it essential?
- Cloud Computing allows users to use applications without installation, hence increasing the computing efficiency and processing speed.
- It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.
- Disaster recovery and data security are amongst the most important benifits. Also the maintenance cost is reduced.

### What is *Scalability* in Cloud Computing?
- In Cloud computing, you can add or substract resources for your machine, including memory or storage, as per requirement.
- It provides flexibility that saves time and money.
- When Demand increases, its easy to scale up to accomodate the new load.
- When Demand goes down, we can scale down accordingly.
- Without making expensive changes to your setup, we can support business growth.

### What is a Markdown Language?
- We all know HTML is a Markup language but there is a Markdown language.
- It is used to style the text of the documents, formatting etc.
- We can control the format of words(Bold or Italic), adding images and a few more things.

### What is *GitHub*? Why should i use it?
- Github provides a platform for the developer community to find, share, collaborate together on multiple projects.
- It grants various features, thus simplifying the process of working in a team.
- Members can work on files/projects and easily merge their changes in the master branch of the project.

> # Features of **Github**
 1. Repository.
 2. Star.
 3. Watch.
 4. Forking.
 5. Pull request and Merge.
 
 ### Repositories:
- A repository is like a folder for your project.
- Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's history. 
- You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. 

 ### Forking:
 - Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
 - This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 

 ### Star:
 - People can star other repositories as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
 
 ### Watch:
 - You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and changes that are created.
 
 ### Pull request and Merge:
 - If you want to make any changes, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner of the repository.
 - That user can then, merge the changes in the original repository.

 > Today I learned:-
  1. Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing.
  2. Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).
  
### Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing
 
 - Data is the most valuable asset. Its loss can result in massive damage to your business, even the loss of reputation.
 - It is hard to predict when a disaster will occur and how serious its impact will be.
 - Cloud disaster recovery stores the system data on a remote cloud-based platform.
 - With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary recovery site.
 - You can always have a backup copy, even if one of the cloud data centers fails.
 - State-of-the-art network infrastructure of the cloud provider ensures that there are'nt any issues or errors. 
 
 ----

> ### Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx)

 - **Understanding CapEx:**
 1. Capital expenditures are Equipments or services that are bought to improve or support a company's performance in the future.
    example: A Production house buys Camera's, photostudios, shooting equipments. This becomes the capital expenditure spent by the Production house.
 2. The expenses made should profit the company in the future. 
 3. The expenses become fixed assests and the value depreciates with time.
 4. There's only little guarantee that the investment activities brings sucess to the company in its useful life period.
 5. Capital expenditures (CAPEX) are a company's major, long-term investments.
  
  
 - **Understanding OpEx:**
 1. Operating expenses are the costs a company incurs for running their day-to-day operations.
 2. These are examples of operating expenses: Rent and utilities.
 3. The goal of any company is to maximize profits in near future as compared to CapEx.
 4. If the company is unsure of it's future, it won't risk a hefty amount of debt upon itself and the company will choose to rent a piece of equipment instead of purchasing .
 
 ### CLOUD COMPUTING – CAPEX VS. OPEX
 - Cloud service providers allows companies to use a “pay as they go” or OpEx model, which allows companies to use the Virtual Machines as per their requirement and the security of cloud.
 - There is potential cost benefits throughout the year.
 - Rather than just buying the complete hardware and paying for the network, the consumers would have the right resources in the form of **virtual machines** at the right time, without overspending.
 
 With the OpEx model, companies wanting to try a new product or service don't need to invest in equipment. Instead, they pay as much or as little for the infrastructure as required.

OpEx is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or is unknown. Cloud services are often said to be agile. Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure to adapt to the evolving needs of the business. 

For example, if your service peaks one month, you can scale to demand and pay a larger bill for the month. If the following month the demand drops, you can reduce the used resources and be charged less. This agility lets you manage your costs dynamically, optimizing spending as requirements change.

> # Cloud Storage:
- Cloud services have become the most suitable option for storing data online digitally.
- In the earlier times, most of the companies used to depend on their private servers for storing their growing collection of data and online files; but today storing data online on cloud servers is the next big thing as it allows unlimited storage. 
- The best thing about storing all the data in the cloud is that it ensures affordability and the data can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world.

----
##  Benefits of online data storage in the cloud:
 
 
### Usability And Accessibility
- Users can easily upload the files in the cloud storage.
- It is easy to save all the files and data in the cloud, no technical knowledge is required for this purpose.
- The stored files can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks and an internet connection. 

### Disaster Recovery
- It is recommended for every business to have a backup plan in case of any emergency. 
- After all, losing important business data can cause huge losses to any business.
- Cloud storage is the perfect backup plan for businesses. It creates a backup of the files stored.
- These files are stored at a remote location and they can be retrieved and accessed at any time.

### Security
- Business owners can be sure that once the data is stored in the cloud, it is safe. 
- The best thing about using cloud storage is that server data is distributed across many servers and the data stored in the cloud is protected against any type of hardware failure. 
- Cloud servers also provide automated backups in order to make sure that your data is safe.

### Cost Savings
- Businesses and organizations can reduce annual operating costs by utilizing cloud storage. 
- Affordability can be ensured if data is stored online in the cloud. 
- Users can ensure additional cost savings because internal power and resources are not required separately for storing the data.

### Easy Sharing
- Data stored in cloud storage can be easily shared with clients and colleagues in an easy and secure way.
 
### Automation
- With cloud storage technology, the tedious task of data backups is simplified through automation. 
- You simply have to select what you want to backup and when you want to backup and your cloud environment will take care of the rest.
 
### Collaboration
- A cloud environment enables multiple people to access, edit and collaborate on a single file or document.
- People can access the cloud environment from anywhere in the world and collaborate in real-time. 
 
### Scalable Service
- Cloud hosting makes sure that you only pay for the resources that you actually use. 
- You can scale your cloud hosting environment whenever required and you can also define the attributes of scaling the cloud.
- This ensures more flexibility and a large storage space. 
 
### Convenience
- Even if you store data on transportable devices like external hard drives or flash drives, some kind of manual intervention and physical handling is required. 
- The data that is stored in a cloud is backed up online and it can be accessed from anywhere.

#### Hence, Online cloud storage and backup is beneficial for all types of businesses.

> ## Scaling in Cloud Computing:

1. Scaling is the ability of a  company or organisation to handle increasing or decreasing demands in a capable manner, so that the coustomers or the company itself don't face any issue because of the fluctuating demands.
2. Thus, scalability is a planned level of capacity that can grow or shrink as needed.
3. There are 3 ways to **Scale in cloud.**

## 1st] Vertical Scaling(Up scaling):
- With Cloud computing, you can add or subtract resources, like storage or processing power.
- You can take a example of a Multi-level parking lot.
- There's almost countless space, that vehicles can occupy anytime. Mostly there's alot of space available as the place is almost never completely occupied, as long as the capacity is not exceeded. 
- Similarly changes can be made in your Vm as per the need.
- This is **Vertical Scaling**

## 2nd] Horizontal Scaling(Out Scaling):
- Horizontal scaling refers to adding more **servers** to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling.
- This method take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together.
- You can also handle traffic efficiently and execute complex workloads.

## 3rd] Diagonal Scaling(Mixed Scaling):
- When we combine Horizontalal and Vertical Scalinng together, We get Diagonal Scaling.
- It is the most efficient infrastructure scaling. 
- It is simply increasing the resources of our existing servers untill it reaches it's limit.
- Then we can add more servers to our infrastructure and continue with our process.

### Takeaway:
- We experience great amount of flexibility that saves both money and time for a business.
- Cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go model. 
- This on-demand nature is what makes the cloud so easy and intresting.

----
## What is **Latency in Cloud Computing?**

- Cloud service latency is the delay of time between a client request and a cloud service provider’s response.
- Let's take a example:
  - Imagine you went to a restaurant and order something. 
  - There's a time delay in preparing the dish, and serving it to your table.
  - This is Latency.
  - Also, Buffering delays of online video streaming is Latency. 
- We as a Client request some service or something to the Cloud provider and in return the provider fulfills our request.
- Latency greatly affects how usable and enjoyable devices and communication requests are.
- We as customers certainly wish our Client reqests get solved within no time.
- It is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another in networking. 

### POSSIBLE CAUSES OF NETWORK LATENCY

1. **DNS Server Errors:**

A faulty DNS server can be a cause of the poor performance of an application. Errors like 404’s and incorrect pathways can prevent potential visitors to reach your website.

2. **Poorly Optimized Backend Database:**

Over-utilized databases can slow down your website severely. Also, higher table joins, complicated calculations, presence of large tables with long fields, and improper use of indexes are some of the common reasons for slow databases.

3. **Low Memory Space:**

Low disk space is another reason system performance can decrease. In case of low disk space, the operating system will struggle and try to maintain RAM requirements being used by programs.

4. **Selection of Transmission Mediums:**

Companies must carefully select the transmission media as it directly affects the speed of a signal. In a fiber-optic network, when an optical signal travels in a fiber link, latency occurs at every stage. Latency keeps increasing during every conversion, right from the time when the signal converts from electrical to optical domain, when it goes through the fiber, and finally when it converts from optical to electrical domain.

5. **Multiple Routers:**

Routers take time to process the information in the header of a packet. When a packet transfers from router to router, the latency time gets increased.

### Cloud Latency Issues

#### Given below five layers of complexity which affects on cloud latency:

**1. Distributed computing**:- 

Is is one component adding to cloud latency’s complexity. With enterprise data centers a thing of the past, the nature of applications has completely changed from being contained within a local infrastructure to being distributed all over the world.

The problem lies in the fact that these applications, which are deployed all over the world, have varying degrees of latency with each of their Internet connections. -
- Furthermore, latencies are entirely dependent on Internet traffic, which waxes and wanes to compete for the same bandwidth and infrastructure.

**2. Virtualization**:- 

Virtualization adds another layer of complexity to latency in the cloud. Gone are the days of rack-mounted servers; enterprises are building virtualized environments for consolidation and cost efficiency, and today’s data centers are now a complex web of hypervisors running dozens of virtual machines. Unfortunately, virtualized network infrastructure can introduce its own series of packet delays before the data even leaves the rack itself.

**3. lack of measurement tools**:-

For modern applications. While ping and traceroute can be used to test Internet connection, modern applications don’t have anything to do with ICMP, the protocol behind these tracing devices. Instead, modern applications and networks use other protocols such as HTTP and FTP and therefore need to try to measure their performances accordingly.

**4. Evasive cloud providers**:-

Evasive cloud providers who sometimes neglect to inform you about where their cloud data centers are located, can also complicate latency.

While tools are of course helpful in providing insight on trends, the overarching solution to measuring and mitigating cloud latency is providing more consistent network connections.

----
## Load balancing in Cloud Computing:

- Cloud load balancing is defined as the method of splitting workloads and computing properties in a cloud computing.
- It helps companies to manage workload demands or application demands by distributing resources among numerous computers, networks or servers.
- The traffic on the internet grows rapidly, hence, the workload on the server grows fast which leads to the overloading of servers in various Organisations.
- There are two methords to overcome the problem of overloading on the servers-
- First is a single-server solution in which the server is upgraded to a higher performance server.
- But the new server may also be overloaded soon, demanding another upgrade. 
- Also the upgrading process is arduous and expensive.
- Second is a multiple-server solution in which a scalable service system on a cluster of servers is built. 
- It is more cost effective as well as more scalable to build a server cluster system for network services.

## Importance of Load Balancing

1. **Better Performance:**
- Load balancing techniques are less expensive and easy to implement as compared to its other options available.
- Organizations can work on their client's applications much more faster and deliver better performance at relatively lower costs.

2. **Maintain Website Traffic:**
- Cloud Balancing provides scalability to control website traffic. 
- With the help of effective load balancers, you can easily manage high-end user traffic with the servers and network devices.
- Cloud balancing plays a crucial role for e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart, who are dealing with millions of visitors every single second. 
- Load balancers help them distribute and manage workloads at the time of promotional and sale offers.

3. **Handle Sudden Traffic Burst:**
- Load balancers have this ability to handle any sudden traffic received at a particular time.
- For example, a College or University website can shut down during result declaration due to too many requests arrivals at the same time.
- If they are using load balancers they do not have to worry about any amount of traffic burst. 
- No matter how big is the traffic, load balancers equally divide entire website load into different servers for maximum results in a minimum response time.

4. **Flexibility:**
- The main objective of using a load balancer is to protect the website from a sudden shutdown.
- When the workload is distributed among a number of servers, even if one of them fails, the load could be shifted to another one.
- This shows scalability, flexibility and the handling ability of traffic.

----
> # **Uptime and Downtime:**

1. A growing challenge for applications is obtaining optimal availability at all times. 
2. Uptime is a computer industry term for the time during which a computer is operational.
3. Downtime is the time when it isn't operational. 

## More about Uptime:
- Uptime is very important for businesses who rely heavily on their websites, or whose customers rely on them.
- If customers start thinking your business’ website is unreliable, they may stop coming back, resulting in loss of sales. 
- If Search engines like Google start to fail often, people might think that their website is unreliable, they will stop visiting as well, resulting in poor search engine results.
- Uptime is measured in terms of a percentile. 
- For example, one standard for uptime that is a goal of a computer that is operational 99.999 percent of the time.
- Many cloud hosting companies create aggressive SLAs around their uptime guarantee, whether it’s a 99%, 99.9%, or 100% uptime guarantee. 
- Having a hosting provider that guarantees uptime is much better than one that doesn’t. 
- Keep in mind – uptime guarantees do not include scheduled outages or maintenance.

## More about Downtime:
- Downtime refers to periods of time during which a computer system, server or network is shut off or unavailable for use. 
- Systems go through periods of downtime for a number  of reasons, including power or hardware failure, system crashes, hacker attacks, system reboots, operating system and/or software updates, lack of network connectivity and more.
- While some downtime events are planned as part of maintenance schedules ("planned downtime"), in many cases periods of downtime result from unplanned or unexpected events like network outages and hardware failure.
- Downtime might result in huge losses for big businesses.

> # Summary

Every business has different needs and requirements. Cloud computing is flexible and cost-efficient, which can be beneficial to every business, whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise.

> ## **Client-Server Computing**

In Client-Server Computing, the clients requests a resource and the server provides that resource.
- A server may serve multiple clients at the same time while a client is in contact with only one server. 
- Both the client and server usually communicate via a computer network but sometimes they may exist in the same system.

A client does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web

An illustration of the client server system is given as follows:

![Client Server Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/83909087-c113a300-a785-11ea-89fd-873d1d393dd0.png)

### **Client Server Architecture**
**Characteristics of Client-Server Computing**

The salient points for Client-Server Computing are as follows:

The client server computing works with a system of request and response. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the desired information.

The client and server should follow a common communication protocol so they can easily interact with each other. All the communication protocols are available at the application layer.

A server can only accommodate a limited number of client requests at a time. So it uses a system based to priority to respond to the requests.
Denial of Service attacks hinders servers ability to respond to authentic client requests by inundating it with false requests.

An example of a client server computing system is a web server. It returns the web pages to the clients that requested them.

### Difference between Client-Server Computing and Peer to Peer Computing

The major differences between client server computing and peer to peer computing are as follows:

- In client server computing, a server is a central node that services many client nodes. 
- On the other hand, in a peer to peer system, the nodes collectively use their resources and communicate with each other.
- In client server computing the server is the one that communicates with the other nodes.
- In peer to peer to computing, all the nodes are equal and share data with each other directly.
- Client Server computing is believed to be a subcategory of the peer to peer computing.
## Advantages of Client-Server Computing
The different Advantages of client server computing are:

- All the required data is concentrated in a single place i.e. the server.
- So it is easy to protect the data and provide authorisation and authentication.
- The server need not be located physically close to the clients. Yet the data can be accessed efficiently.
- It is easy to replace, upgrade or relocate the nodes in the client server model because all the nodes are independent and request data only from the server.
- All the nodes i.e clients and server may not be build on similar platforms yet they can easily facilitate the transfer of data.

## Disadvantages of Client-Server Computing
The different disadvantages of client server computing are:

- If all the clients simultaneously request data from the server, it may get overloaded. 
- This may lead to congestion in the network or we call it as Latency.
- If the server fails for any reason, then none of the requests of the clients can be fulfilled. This leads of failure of the client-server network.
The cost of setting and maintaining a client server model are quite high.

# Cloud Computing Trends To Watch In 2020

### Introduction:

Cloud computing was perhaps the most smoking point in innovation and business media all through 2019. This is nothing unexpected as the cloud segment has been developing quickly throughout the last few years. With every New year starting with its specific goals for the normal people, similarly, for the IT business also consistently accompanies a goal in Cloud Computing.
- Cloud computing and cloud storage have created crucial exposure and interest around the globe. 

Each organization needs cloud services in the two structures to keep up their everyday business activities. Organizations understand the most critical advantages to cloud innovation, and in any case, many are confused about its utilization.
- Cloud is scalable, robust, and cost-productive. 

Cloud innovation is useful for application development, utilizing the cloud for custom application development has demonstrated to be prevalent. We are simply starting to observe the development of this idea into a transformation. 

Cloud computing changes the manner in which we consider data, the manner in which organizations consider their operations and the manner in which engineers consider building. 

### Let’s look at some of the cloud computing trends that will take place in 2020.

**1. Serverless Computing:**

As a Part of Cloud computing advancement, serverless computing has seen an ascent in popularity. Serverless computing, with an alert, is an extensive improvement. Not every person is prepared for it. The paradigm of advancing and making conventional innovation needs to go serverless.
- It redistributes the whole foundation.
- It’s beginning and end apart from the application itself.

The happening of the serverless model, which has a conventional structure that uses a “pay as you go” system. These programs are truly flexible and enable organizations to have more command over their expenses in cloud hosting.
