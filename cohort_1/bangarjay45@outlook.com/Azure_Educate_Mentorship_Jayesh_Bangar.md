> # **Microsoft Azure**


1. Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. 
2. It provides a range of cloud services, including computing, analytics, storage and networking. 
3. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.
4. It offers tools that support all industries while aiming to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. 
5. Azure also charges you on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.

## Working:

- Azure offers 4 different forms of cloud computing services:
  - infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - platform as a service (PaaS)
  - software as a service (SaaS) and 
  - serverless.
- Users can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VM) and databases.  
- A number of third-party sellers also make multiple softwares directly available through Azure.
  
> # Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS) Singapore.
After rigorous assessments conducted by the MTCS Certification Body, Microsoft cloud services received MTCS 584:2013 certification across all three service classifications:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

Microsoft was the first global cloud solution provider (CSP) to receive this certification across all three classifications.  
  
## Microsoft provides five different customer support options for Azure:

- Basic
- Developer
- Standard
- Professional Direct
- Premier 
- These plans vary in terms of scope and price.

### What do most people use Azure for:

- The platform is frequently used for backup and disaster recovery.
- Its use cases are extremely diverse.
- Running virtual machines or containers in the cloud is one of the most popular uses for Microsoft Azure
- Azure is also commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in the cloud.
- Azure supports open source technologies, so you can use the tools and technologies you prefer. 
- Run virtually any application using your data source, with your operating system, on your device. 
- Azure is the only consistent hybrid cloud, has more regions than any cloud provider, delivers.


> # **Virtual Network(VNet):**

1. An virtual network(VNet) is a representation of your own network in Cloud.
2. It is similar to our own on-premise network which we use at home.
3. It is an isolation of Azure cloud Network dedicated to your own subscription.
4. If you have your own **Subscripton** in Azure, this VNet is completely dedicated to you/your organisation. 
5. They are completely isolated from other virtual networks, unless you establish a connection between two virtual networks.

## On-premise Network and Vnet:

- In a On-premise network, to have accesibilty to public internet, it has to have a firewall, it has to send requests and receive requests throught a router.
- Hence a organisation will have to set up a router and a firewall/Multiple firewalls and the physical computer machines in the organisation.
- These physical computers would have their own unique ip addresses.
- Whenever a request is initiated for a pericular virtual machine, it comes from a IP address.
- It gets divided between the different web servers which are also VM’s, and the program will get executed.
- In AZURE, the equivalent of this whole network setup, is called as VNet.
- VNet is a service from Azure similar to the infrastructure. It is entirely a virtual setup.
- Azure infrastructure takes the role of the router. 
- It allows the access from the vnet to the public internet without any need of any type of configuration.

## Pricing in VNet:
- There is no extra cost for using VNet in Azure.
- The Computing usage of internet within the vnet will be charged as per the standard rates decribed in the Azure VM pricing.
- The VPN Gateways and Public IP Addresses used in the VNet will aslo be charged.

## **VNet benefits:**

### Isolation-
- VNets are completely isolated from one another.
- Nobody can access that Network unless the permission is granted.
- Also gives you the ability to create multiple environments for your Organisation.
- These environments are created for multiple reasons.
- You can create one environment which is purely for development, other purely for testing or production etc.
- They also can be entirely replica of each other for consistency.
- The possibilities are basically endless.

### Access to Public Internet-
- Every VM created will have by default access to  public internet.
- You can also control the access	by using **Network Security Grougs(NSG) and Firewalls**. 

### Security-
- Internet Traffic entering and exiting i.e. requests sent and received, on the VM, in the VNet can be controlled using Network Security Groups.

### Connectivity-
- If you want to connect a Secured Connection to VNet from your laptop, you can establish a VPN tunnel between your own PC to VNet, this is also possible.
- It is called as Point to Site Network.
- You can also connect multiple On-site PC’s to your VNet. 
- It is referred as Site to Site Network.
- Hybrid connectivity is possible.

### You can fully control the IP addresses, DNS servers, security policies.

### Vnet is further broken down into subnets. 
#### These are the Advantages VNet offers.

> VNet Overview:
In the following figure, VMs are represented as web servers and database servers. Each set of VMs are assigned to separate subnets in the VNet.
<img width="343" alt="vnetoverview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/83379660-b6f64b00-a3f9-11ea-8add-665d3f21c07d.png">

You can create a VNet before or as you create a VM. You create these resources to support communication with a VM:

- Network interfaces
- IP addresses
- Virtual network and subnets

In addition to those basic resources, you should also consider these optional resources:

- Network security groups
- Load balancers 


## Network Interface(NIC):
A [network interface (NIC)](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface.md) is the interconnection between a VM and a virtual network (VNet). A VM must have at least one NIC, but can have more than one, depending on the size of the VM you create.
- Network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network.
- A Network interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form. 
- Instead, the network interface can be implemented in software.

You can create a VM with multiple NICs, and add or remove NICs through the lifecycle of a VM. Multiple NICs allow a VM to connect to different subnets and send or receive traffic over the most appropriate interface. VMs with any number of network interfaces can exist in the same availability set, up to the number supported by the VM size. 


## Subnets
**subnets:**

1. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the VNet. 
2. You can divide a VNet into multiple subnets for organization and security.  
3. Each NIC in a VM is connected to one subnet in one VNet.
4. NICs connected to subnets (same or different) within a VNet can communicate with each other without any extra configuration.

When you set up a VNet, you specify the topology, including the available address spaces and subnets. 

If the VNet is to be connected to other VNets or on-premises networks, you must select address ranges that don't overlap. The IP addresses are private and can't be accessed from the Internet.
 

By default, there is no security boundary between subnets, so VMs in each of these subnets can talk to one another. However, you can set up Network Security Groups (NSGs), which allow you to control the traffic flow to and from subnets and to and from VMs.

Networks are somewhat beautiful. A subnet is a division of another subnet you can slice into smaller subnets. It’s called subnetting. But there are some rules on Azure.

Before starting the subnet design, we need to think about your future needs. One needs can be to connect VM to on-premises networks. So, you may need to implement an Azure VPN gateway.


> # **Network Security Groups(NSG)**

-	NSG is nothing but a list or set of rules.
-	These are used to allow or deny traffic to your Virtual Machines.

Secuirty is an important aspect when you expose your Data or appliances to the outside world in internet. 
- Because of the tremendous risk of attacks that can happen from the internet to your infrastructure as well as your Data, you need to have the right security tools in place to protect all the resources in your **Cloud Computing environment**.
-	NSG is one of the tool that can be used for your VM to allow or deny traffic to and from your VM's.
-	This is a Security mechanism thats available for your VM's.

Examples:
> **Case 1:**

-	In a VNet in Azure, by default, communications is possible between the Subnets when you create them. Two VM's are shown here. 
![Screenshot_20200604-221608_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/83788221-7ecd6180-a6b2-11ea-9795-b21e33b261a1.png)
-	This is one of the cases that uses NSG.
-	Communication is established between them.
-	There could be special cases where you want to isolate the two VM's completely.
-	This could be because of different requirements or security aspects such as Storing Critical Data.
-	If the two VM's are in the same Virtual network as a part of two subnets, you can define NSG to block the traffic.
![Screenshot_20200604-221619_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/83788605-16cb4b00-a6b3-11ea-8e92-1297da34e2dc.png)
Here the VM's are completely isolated.

> **Case 2:**

Another use case scenario is when you have a VM in a VNet in Azure and you only want to allow a certain traffic from a particular **workstation**, you can create a NSG rule which only allows a **remote desktop connection** from this particular workstation only. 

This allows no one except that workstation the ability to connect to your machine in Azure via **remote desktop connection**.

![Screenshot_20200604-221653_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/83788996-b7216f80-a6b3-11ea-8591-b94293f003fa.png)
These are some of the many cases where NSG is used in Azure.

> **Takeaway**

-	There are two separate set of rules that can be managed i.e. Inbound and Outbound rules.
-	Inbound traffic: The traffic that comes into your Machine.
-	Outbound traffic: The traffic that flows out of your Machine.
-	For each of the rules, you define what is the Source IP and Source Port Number of the Workstation.
-	You also specify the Destination IP and the Destination Port Number of the Client VM.
-	You next have to specify what are the protocols that are allowed. Ex. HTTP, HTTPS, TCP etc.
-	And then the Priority i.e. You can have different rules in your NSG each having diffenet priority. And the one which will have the most priority will override others having least priority.
-	Then you have to specify if it’s an allow or deny rule.
