# _1. Basic Intro to Cloud Computing_
*  Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet. These services are divided into three main categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. 

# _2. What are the uses of Cloud Computing?_
* The basic that cloud computing has provided to the computer users is that it allows them access to the same kinds of applications through the internet. Users can store their data and important files virtually and can  always carry them with themselves wherever they goes and can access whenever they need.

# _3. What is the basic concept of GitHub?_
* GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

# _4. What is Markdown Language?_
* Markdown is a lightweight markup language for adding formatting elements to plain text. The Markdown editor helps you to perform basic editing capabilities: manage headings, apply formatting to text to make it bold or italic, and so on. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

# _5. What is Github used for and its important characteristics?_
* GitHub offers the following features:
  * Collaboration.
  * Integrated issue and bug tracking.
  * Graphical representation of branches.
  * Approximately 6 million hosted git repositories.
  * Code review.
  * Project management.
  * Team management.
  * Social coding.
* Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. GitHub offers plans free of charge, and professional and enterprise accounts. 

# _6. How GitHub is useful from perspective of Job and placement?_
* The ability to show code gave birth to some unfortunate expectations, and a number of employers began equating GitHub repos and open-source contribution as an exclusive requirement for employment consideration. The "GitHub is your résumé" trope emerged in response to employers doing this. alongside a number of excellent posts explaining why this idea needed to die.
 * Job seekers who benefit most from GitHub projects:
   * Recent college graduates
   * Bootcampers and autodidacts
   * Experienced developers seeking transition

# _7. What do you mean by centralised system?_
* A system where decisions for the system goal are made in a central mechanism and transmitted to executive componentsThe concept of a centralized system is one which has a major hub or hubs which peers communicate with. This system allows peers to be freed from certain efforts, giving them to the central body. Maintaining easily accessed and accurately updated lists of information on all clients is one way in which a central body shines.

# _Benefits of Cloud computing_
* There are lots of benefits of using cloud computing. It is very user friendly and makes easier to store and access data on any system around the globe.
<br> Following are the benefits of cloud computing are:-
  * Cost Savings :
    * Cloud Computing is a cost saving technology. If you don't want to utilize all the 
resources of PCs then no need to purchase all the amount will be saved in your pocket. That cost can be used in other infrastructure developing.
  * Data security
    * Cloud offers many advanced security features that guarantee that data is securely stored and handled. Cloud storage providers implement baseline protections for their platforms and the data they process, such authentication, access control, and encryption.
  * Scalability
    * Cloud based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.
  * Mobility
    * Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.
  * Disaster recovery
    * Cloud infrastructure can also help you with loss prevention. If you rely on traditional on-premises approach, all your data will be stored locally, on office computers. Despite your best efforts, computers can malfunction from various reasons -- from malware and viruses, to age-related hardware deterioration, to simple user error. But, if you upload your data to the cloud, it remains accesible for any computer with an internet connection.
  * Control
    * Cloud enables you complete visibility and control over your data. You can easily decide which users have what level of access to what data. This gives you control, but it also streamlines work since staff will easily know what documents are assigned to them. It will also increase and ease collaboration.
  * Competitive edge
    * Cloud adoption increases every year, since companies realize that it offers them access to world-class enterprise technology. And, if you implement a cloud solution now, you'll be ahead of your competitors. 
  * Automatic Software Updates : 
    *  It keeps all your software up-to-dates and notifes on new upgrades.

# _What do mean by Cloud Disaster Recovery System?_ 
*  Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform. Cloud disaster recovery is primarily an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution that backs up designated system data on a remote offsite cloud server. It provides updated recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) in case of a disaster or system restore.A cloud-based disaster recovery solution enables the user to scale up the entire cloud DRP solution from some-to-many. The user is normally billed on a monthly basis only for the storage and client software licenses.
