## Overview of AWS 
Cloud computing has become an integral part of businesses across all industries. AWS is the most popular form. It improves efficiency and provides relief for any number of business practices.

Back in the 2000s, businesses were completely dependent on purchased servers, and those servers had limited functionality and steep prices. Plus, a functioning server required countless validations. The more growth businesses experienced, the more servers and optimization practices they needed. Acquiring those items proved inefficient, and, sometimes, prohibitively expensive.

The advantages of AWS have solved many of those problems. Companies using AWS have servers available instantly, and AWS provides various workloads, increased storage options, and enhanced security measures.
