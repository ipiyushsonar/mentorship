# _1. Brief introduction of Cloud computing._
* Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. It goes back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic server's infrastructure of the Internet as nothing but a unstructured network accepting connections and giving out information as it floats. Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network.

# _2. Why do we use Cloud computing?_
* Cloud computing used for computing based on the internet. In the past, people would run applications or programs from software downloaded on a physical computer or server in their building. Cloud computing allows people access to the same kinds of applications through the internet 
Some of the benefits of cloud computing are:-

  * _Efficiency_
  * _Cost reduction_
  * _Data security_
  * _Scalability_
  * _Mobility_

  

# _3. What is the basic concept of GitHub?_
* GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
It connects the developers and coders from all over the world with each other to share knowledge and work together.
# _4. How GitHub is useful from perspective of Job and placement?_
* GitHub is a repository where you can post all your technical stuffs. It is like your technical profile where one can see all your progress related to technical skills. If one share the link of its GitHub account on resume then the selector directly check your technical skills through your account. They can track your contribution abd ratings on your work.
# _5. How we can use GitHub, and what are the features of GitHub?_
* GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. It allows you to share your code and edit in others code. You can use this essential features provided by GitHub and perform a lot of task.
  * _Repository:-_
    * A GitHub repository can be used to store a development * project.
  * _Branch:-_
    * A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time.
  * _Pull Requests:-_
    * Requests are use to propose request to merge our changes.
  * _Commit:-_
    * We can accept the committed changes by this.

# _6. What is markdown language?_
* Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. When we create a Markdown-formatted file, we add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. 
<br>Symbols like #,>,_ and many more are used to define a particular style or formatting. Html tags can also be used to insert list, tables, images etc.
<br>One example of this formatting is given below:
* __Syntax:-__ 
<br>| Syntax      | Description |
<br>  | ----------- | ----------- |
<br>  | Header      | Title       |
<br>  | Paragraph   | Text        |
<br>

* __Result:-__
  | Syntax      | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Header      | Title       |
  | Paragraph   | Text        |






# _7. What do mean by centralised system?_
* Centralized systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations where client sends a request to a company server and receives the response.

  * _Example:-_
    * Consider when we request a site to ahe web server, and it loads for us that site. Then we are Web client and server who is providing the data is working as a centralised system for a all the web clients.

> ### _Cloud Disaster Recovery system._
> 1. _What is Cloud disaster recovery system?_ 
> 2. _One example on how Cloud disaster recovery system works._
# _What is Cloud disaster recovery system?_ 
*  Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.
<br> Cloud disaster recovery typically provides similar services as an on-premises or company-maintained off-premises disaster recovery plan (DRP) facility, but in an economical, efficient and provider-managed platform. 
Disaster recovery helps in restoring applications, data, and hardware quickly for business continuity. Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is a documented, structured approach with instructions to recover disrupted systems and networks and it helps organizations to run business as close to normal as possible.
# _One example on how Cloud disaster recovery system works._
* Example:-
  * Consider, if you are working on a very important project of your company containing a lot of data, trained tools and data obtained after months of surveys. And imagine suddenly while working you lost all your data due to natural disasters, pandemic, cyber attacks, or even planned upgrades/maintenance that require shutting down production infrastructures. It will be a huge loss to you and your company and then you have to work again to obtain these data. Sometimes this data can be so important and confidential that its lost is not bearable. 
  * In such situation, imagine if you have a service that can have a backup of all the data you have worked on and can provide you back all your data! 
  * Yes this backup can be obtained by _disaster recovery system of cloud computing._
* If we do disaster recovery on our own it requires constant maintenance and support on our part. In this case, data protection and disaster recovery are performed manually, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.
* On the other hand, Disaster recovery in cloud computing entails storing critical data and applications in cloud storage and failing over to a secondary site in case of a disaster. Cloud computing services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time. Backup and disaster recovery in cloud computing can be automated, requiring minimum input on our part.

> 1. _What is Capital expenditure (CapEx)?_
> 2. _What is Operational expenditure (OpEx)_
> 3. _Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)_
# _1. What is Capital expenditure (CapEx)?_
* Capital expenditures (CapEx) refer to funds that are used by a company for the purchase, improvement, or maintenance of long-term assets to improve the efficiency or capacity of the company. Long-term assets are usually physical, fixed and non-consumable assets such as property, equipment, or infrastructure, and that have a useful life of more than one accounting period.
<br> Capital expenditures include _the purchase of items such as new equipment, machinery, land, plant, buildings or warehouses, furniture and fixtures, business vehicles, software, or intangible assets such as a patent or license._
* ## Types of Capital expenditure (CapEx):
     There are two types of expenditure-
     * Expenses for the maintenance of levels of operation present within the company and 
     * Expenses that will enable an increase in future growth.
* ## Included in capital expenditures are amounts spent on:
     * acquiring fixed, and in some cases, intangible assets
     * repairing an existing asset so as to improve its useful life
     * upgrading an existing asset if it results in a superior fixture
     * preparing an asset to be used in business
     * restoring property or adapting it to a new or different use
     * starting or acquiring a new business
# _2. What is Operational expenditure (OpEx)_
* An operational expenditure (Opex) is the money a company spends on an ongoing, day-to-day basis in order to run a business or system. Depending upon the industry, these expenses can range from the ink used to print documents to the wages paid to employees.
<br> In brief, "operating expenses" include most expenditures for operating the firm's usual line of busines—expenditures that are not capital spending. Operating expenses do not result in capital assets. Instead, they serve entirely for—not surprisingly—"operating" the business. Accountants calculate "profits" by subtracting the period's expenses from the period's incoming revenues.
Operating expenses include:

* ## Operating expenses include:

  * accounting expenses
  * license fees
  * maintenance and repairs, such as snow removal, trash removal, janitorial service, pest control, and lawn care
  * advertising
  * office expenses
  * supplies
  * attorney fees and legal fees
  * utilities, such as telephone
  * insurance
  * property management
  * travel and vehicle expenses
  * leasing commissions
  * salary and wages
# _3. Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)_
### The key differences between both are:-

- [ ] Funds that fall under capital expenditures are for major purchases that will be used in the future. The life of these purchases extends beyond the current accounting period in which they were purchased. Because these costs can be recovered only over time through depreciation, companies usually prepare a capital expense budget apart from OPEX.

- [ ] Operating expenses represent the day-to-day expenses necessary to run a business. Because these are short-term costs that are used up in the same accounting period in which they were purchased, it makes sense for them to have a separate budget.

- [ ] CapEx cannot be fully deducted in the period when they were incurred. Tangible assets are depreciated and intangible assets are amortized over time. On the other hand. Operating expenses are fully deducted in the accounting period during which they were incurred.

- [ ] Money spent on inventory falls under capex. While the money spent turning inventory into throughput is opex.
- [ ] CapEx costs incurred for buying the income producing property.	OpEx costs associated with the operation and maintenance of an income producing property.

> 1. _What is Cloud deployment model?
> 2. _What are the different types of Cloud deployment models?_
# _1. What is Cloud deployment model?_
* A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access.
<br>  It is a configuration of environment parameters such as the accessibility and proprietorship of the deployment infrastructure and storage size. It means that deployment types vary depending on who controls the infrastructure and where it resides.
# _2. What are the different types of Cloud deployment models?_
* Depending upon the infrastructure, storage, and accessibility, there are 4 different types of cloud deployment models. They are:-
* ## 1. Public Cloud
     * As the name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers. 
The Server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage them and administer pool resources, which is why there is no need for user companies to buy and maintain their hardware.
The Provider companies offer resources as a service both free of charge or on a pay-per-use basis via the Internet connection. Users can scale resources as per there need.
     * _Advantages:-_ 
        - [ ] Hassle-free infrastructure management
        - [ ] High scalability
        - [ ] Reduced costs
        - [ ] 24/7 uptime
     * _Disadvantages:-_
        - [ ] Compromised reliability
        - [ ] Data security and privacy give rise to concern. 
        - [ ] The lack of a bespoke service. 
* ## 2. Private cloud
     * Only one organization uses this deployment model to run its workloads, and the server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the user company
There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar.
A private model is especially suitable for companies that seek to safeguard their mission-critical operations or for businesses with changing requirements.
     * Advantages:-
       - [ ] Bespoke and flexible development
       - [ ] High security, privacy and reliability
       - [ ] High scalability
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] Costly 
       - [ ] Requires considerable expenses on hardware, software and staff training.
* ## 3. Community cloud
     * In the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.
If the organizations have uniform security, privacy and performance requirements, this multi-tenant data center architecture helps companies achieve their business-specific objectives.
It is particularly suited for organizations that work on joint projects. In that case, a centralized cloud facilitates project development, management and implementation. Also, the costs are shared across all users.
     * Advantages:- 
       - [ ] Cost reduction
       - [ ] Improved security, privacy and reliability
       - [ ] Ease of data sharing and collaboration
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] High cost if compared to a public deployment model
       - [ ] Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity
* ## 4. Hybrid cloud 
     *  A hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above-mentioned deployment models — public, private and community ones. It allows companies to mix and match the facets of all three types that best suit their requirements.

     * Advantages:- 
       - [ ] Improved security and privacy
       - [ ] Enhanced scalability and flexibility
       - [ ] Reasonable price
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] The hybrid deployment model only makes sense if companies can split their data into mission-critical and non-sensitive.

> 1. _What is Cloud services?_
> 2. _What are the different types of cloud services?_ 
# _1. What is Cloud service?_
* Cloud service is any service made available to users on demand through the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
They are provided on demand and you have to pay only for the services you require. Thus, cloud services are dynamic and can be scale as per the requirement of users. As the cloud service provider supplies all necessary hardware and software components, so the company didn't need to take care of it, and appoint any staff to manage it. 
- [ ] Example of cloud services include:- 
   * Data storage 
   * Backup solutions 
   * Email services 
   * Hosting 
   * Database handling and processing 
   * Technical support 
# _2. What are the different types of cloud services?_ 
* Cloud computing services falls under three broad categories they are:-
  * _1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)_ 
  * _2. Platform as a service (PaaS)_
  * _3. Software as a service (SaaS)_
<br> Let's know more about them 
### 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
   * IaaS provides the basic building block for cloud IT. It gives access to networking, computer (virtual or dedicated) and data storage space. It is a pay-as-you-go service 
### 2. Platform as a service 
   * PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and software systems). It allows to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy systems involved.  
It is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without thinking about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.
### 3. Software as a service (SaaS)
   * SaaS supplies you a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. Mostly, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to care about the service is maintanance or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You can just focus on the usage of particular software. 
With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching.
   * One other part of cloud service is Serverless computing- Like PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The setup, capacity planning and server management for you is done by the service provider. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, u can use a specific function only when a specific function or trigger occurs using different allocated resourses.

> 1. _What is a region?_
> 2. _What is an Availability Zone?_
> 3. _What is a regional pair?_
> 4. _Examples of how this are provided by service providers._
# _1. What is a region?_
* Regions are geographic locations in which public cloud service providers' data centers reside. 
A region consists of a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated low-latency network. This ensures that services within a region offer the best possible performance and security.
# _2. What is an Availability Zone?_
* The Availability zones (AZs) are isolated locations within data center regions from which public cloud services originate and operate. Businesses choose one or multiple worldwide availability zones for their services depending on business needs.
  * We can select availability zones for our businesses because of many reasons, including compliance and proximity to end customers. 
  * Cloud administrators can also choose to replicate services across multiple availability zones to decrease latency or protect resources. 
  * Admins can move resources to another availability zone in the event of an outage. Certain cloud services may also be limited to particular regions or AZs.
# _3. What is a regional pair?_
* A regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography.
Some services take further advantage of paired regions to ensure business continuity and to protect against data loss. Service providers provides several storage solutions that take advantage of paired regions to ensure data availability.
* Benefits of paired regions:-
  * Physical isolation 
  * Platform-provided replication 
  * Region recovery order 
  * Sequential updates
  * Data residency
# Examples of how this are provided by service providers.
__1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) operates regions in the United States, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Each region contains between two and five availability zones that are geographically separate from one another. Regions are connected to one another through the internet. Each availability zone holds one or more data centers.__

__2. Microsoft Azure assembles availability sets -- VMs linked together for continuous operability -- into regions that are grouped into six geographies: United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan, Brazil and Australia. Azure customers choose between Locally Redundant Storage, in which data is stored locally in the end users' primary region, or Geo Redundant Storage where data is stored more than 250 miles away from the primary region, but in the same geography.__

__3. Google Cloud Platform gathers data centers in regions comprised of zones. Google operates regions of data centers in central United States, Western Europe and East Asia.__

> # Fault Domains
* As every coin has to sides. Just like that technology too offers so many advantages and good things but also comes with a bitter truth that is a hardware requires maintanance and hardware failures.
* Failover enables multiple servers to work together to provide high availability – or put another way, to provide node fault tolerance. But now businesses demand ever-greater availability from their infrastructure. To achieve cloud-like uptime, even highly unlikely occurrences such as chassis failures, rack outages, or natural disasters must be protected against. Thus we need a system with chassis, rack, and site fault tolerance as well.

### A fault domain is a set of hardware components that share a single point of failure. 
* To be fault tolerant to a certain level, you need multiple fault domains at that level. 
* So to be rack fault tolerant, your servers and your data must be distributed across multiple racks.
* Two events Unplanned Hardware maintenance Event and Unexpected Downtime comes under the fault domain.
* Suppose we put two VM into availability set, then it set up VMs to two different racks so that if the network, power, etc. failed,       then only one rack will be affected.
* The Fault domains define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch.
* Each fault domain contains some racks and each rack contains virtual machine.
* Each of these Fault domain shares a power supply and a network switch.
* For example, if there is a failure in the fault domain then all the resources in the fault domain become unavailable.
 Therefore, you should place your vms such a way that each fault domain get one web server, one database server and like that.
### Benefits
  - [ ] It can be used in Storage Spaces, including Storage Spaces Direct, uses fault domains to maximize data safety.
  - [ ] It can be used Health Service to provide more helpful alerts.
  - [ ] It can be used Stretch clustering for storage affinity. 
  
### Levels of fault domains
  There are four levels of fault domains 
  - [ ] site
  - [ ] rack
  - [ ] chassis
  - [ ] node.

# Service-Level Agreements
### A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the bond for performance negotiated between the cloud services provider and the client.
* Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.
* Primarily, in cloud computing all Service Level Agreements were used to negotiated between a client and the service consumer. Nowadays, with the initiation of large utility cloud computing providers, most of them are standardized until a client becomes a large consumer of cloud services.
* If a cloud service provider fails to meet the stated targets of minimums then the provider has to pay the penalty to the cloud service consumer as per the agreement. Thus, Service Level Agreements are like insurance policies in which the corporation has to pay as per the agreements if any crises occurs.
## Service Level Agreement are defined at different levels which are:- 
  * __Customer-based SLA__
    * It is an agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. 
    * Example, an SLA between a supplier (IT service provider) and the finance department of a large organization for the services such as finance system, payroll system, billing system, procurement/purchase system, etc.
  * __Service-based SLA__
    * It is an agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider.
    * Example, An email system for the entire organization. There are chances of difficulties arising in this type of SLA as level of the services being offered may vary for different customers.
  * __Multilevel SLA__
    * In this level SLA is split into the more different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.
    * __Corporate-level SLA:__ It covers all the generic service level management (often abbreviated as SLM) issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. 
    * __Customer-level SLA:__ It covers all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.
    * __Service-level SLA:__ It covers all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.
## Service Level Agreement usually specifies these parameters:-
   * Type of service to be provided
   * Availability of the Service (uptime)
   * Latency or the response time
   * Service components reliability
   * Each party accountability
   * Response and issue resolution time-frame
   * Repercussions for service provider not meeting its commitment
   * Warranties

## Example, of how these SLA's are provided by Microsoft Azure:- 
__Windows Azure SLA –__
Window Azure has different SLA’s for compute and storage.
For compute, there is a guarantee that when a client deploys two or more role instances in separate fault and upgrade domains, client’s internet facing roles will have external connectivity minimum 99.95% of the time. 
Moreover, all of the role instances of the client are monitored and there is guarantee of detection 99.9% of the time when a role instance’s process is not runs and initiates properly.

> 2. _Down-time_
# Up-time
## Uptime is the amount of time that a cloud service hosted by a cloud provider is accessible to end users.
## It says when a computer is working or available and is used as measure of the operating system’s stability or reliability. In this time, the machine may be left unattended and it will not crash. 
## Without knowing uptime, it may be hard to understand a service’s value.
* Example, when a machine has been operational for three weeks continuously, it can be referred to having a three-week uptime.
* Cloud hosting gives you almost perfect uptime and great flexibility.
* An uptime of 99.95% still results in over 4 hours of systems unavailability each year.
* __While, negotiating cloud uptime in a cloud storage service-level agreement (cloud storage SLA), organizations should evaluate the following items:__
1. How fast will the system work when it is up and running? 
2. What is the guaranteed uptime percentage? 
3. What timeframe is the vendor using for its uptime guarantee? 
4. Is scheduled maintenance included in the cloud uptime guarantee? 
5. Does guaranteed uptime require changes to the customer's infrastructure? 
6. What happens if the service goes down? 
7. What are the penalties if the cloud provider doesn't meet its cloud uptime requirements? 

# Down-time
## Downtime or outage duration refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function. 
## The reliability, availability, recovery, and unavailability are related concepts.
## Unavailability is the proportion of a time-span that a system is unavailable or offline. This is usually a result of the system failing to function because of an unplanned event, or because of routine maintenance
* Downtime analysis (DTA) is an essential part of plant operations management as it provides a powerful tool which enables a better understanding of the underlying issues that affect plant availability and rate loss.
* DTA enables identification and quantification of lost production capacity by accurately collecting data and measuring actual overall output against theoretical or rated capacity.
* __Benefits of Downtime analysis are:__
    * Maximizes return on assets
    * Reduces unplanned stoppages and production slowdowns
    * Identifies common equipment failures
    * Compares existing and past performance
    * Identifies areas for improvement

> # _Scaling in Cloud Computing_
## The process of adding and removing Cloud computing resources is called as Cloud Scaling.
## Cloud infastructure and platform are typically priced according to utility model means pay for what you use. Thus, you can scale your resources as per you required them and decrease the amount to pay. 
## This resources can scale up and down very quickly.
## For example, if you take very small amount of resources in the starting of your services. Thev you can increase them as per your utility or requirement increases.
* Following are the common types of Cloud Scaling models:-
  * Vertical Scaling-
    * Vertical scaling refers to adding more resources (CPU/RAM/DISK) to your server (database or application server is still remains one) as on demand. Vertical Scaling is most commonly used in applications and products of middle-range as well as small and middle-sized companies. One of the most common examples of Virtual Scaling is to buy an expensive hardware and use it as a Virtual Machine hypervisor (VMWare ESX).
    * Vertical Scaling usually means upgrade of server hardware.
  * Horizontal Scaling- 
    * Horizontal Scaling is a must use technology – whenever a high availability of (server) services are required
    * Scaling horizontally involves adding more processing units or phyiscal machines to your server or database. It involves growing the number of nodes in the cluster, reducing the responsibilities of each member node by spreading the key space wider and providing additional end-points for client connections. Horizontal Scaling has been historically much more used for high level of computing and for application and services.
  * Auto Scaling- 
    * Scaling that is done automatically using API is called as Auto Scaling. 
    * For example, a bank scales itself horizontally for the settlement process as per the trades it is processing.
  * Side-by-side Scaling-
    * Side-by-side Scaling is the process adding instances for different purposes on demand.
    * For example, a firm that adds development and test instances of a services as required by a project.
  * Gloal Scaling-
    * Gloal Scaling is scaling a service to run in different Geographical locations.
    * For example, a content delivery network that delivers videos from dozens of geographically seperated locations.

# 1. What is a Virtual Machine?
* ## A Virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located anywhere off- or on-premises).
* ## It is known as a guest, is created within a computing environment, called a host. Multiple virtual machines can exist in one host at one time.
* ### They are software computers that provide the same functionality as physical computers. Just like physical computers, they run applications and an operating system. However, virtual machines are computer files that run on a physical computer and behave like a physical computer. In other words, virtual machines behave as separate computer systems.
* A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, it behaves like an actual computer. This machines runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. 
* For example, the virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.

# 2. Why Virtual Machines? 
* ## Virtual machines are created to perform specific tasks that are risky to perform in a host environment, such as accessing virus-infected data and testing operating systems. Since the virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, the software inside the virtual machine cannot tamper with the host computer.
* ## Virtual machines can also be used for other purposes such as server virtualization.
* There are many reasons why your company might consider using virtual machines. It allow for reduceding overhead, with multiple systems operating from the same console and at the same time. VMs also provide a safety of your data, as they can be used to enable rapid disaster recovery and automatic backups.It also offers security. Plus for large and growing businesses, the scalability of virtual environments can be very important to accommodate the growing of a constantly expanding firm. A simulated hardware is a flexible solution to an growing company server, with multi-application, multi-user needs. 
* Thus, following are the reasons for using virtual machines:-
  * Operational flexibility
  * Reducing overhead
  * Centralized management
  * Scalibility
  * Disaster recovery

# 3. How does it works? 
* ## The virtualisarion works on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. 
* It enables us to run more than one virtual system and multiple operating systems and applications on a single server. This results in benefits include economies of scale, lesser cost and greater efficiency.
A single VM is completely independent. Multiple VMs on a single computer enables several operating applications to run on just one physical server called as “host.”
Thin layer of software known as “hypervisor” decouples the virtual machines from the host. Then it dynamically allots resources to each computer as required.
  * The virtual machine architecture system can be broadly classified into four different components, listed from the bottom to up:-
    * An underlying system which includes the physical machine and its operating system. 
    * A hypervisor which acts as a communication and translation layer.
    * Multiple virtual machines that use the host’s resources by communicating with the hypervisor.
    * Applications and processes that run on each guest’s operating system.
# 4. What are the different types of Virtual machine? 
* Different types of Virtual Machine are:-
  * Server Virtualization:-
    * In this type of virtualization multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server as a highly efficient virtual machines is called as server virtualization. Its key advantages are:-
      * Minimize cost 
      * Greater efficiencies 
      * Faster working 
      * Increase applications
      * High server availability 
      * Decrease complexity 
  * Network Virtualization:-
    * Completely reproducing a physical network, network virtualization allows applications to run on a virtual network as they were running on a physical network — but with greater operational benefits and hardware independencies. It presents logical networking devices and services some of them for examples are:-
      * Logical port
      * Switches
      * Routers 
      * Firewalls 
      * Load balancers
      * VPNs 
  * Desktop Virtualization:-
    * Deploying desktops as a managed service enables organisations to respond faster to changing workplace needs and emerging. Virtualized desktops and applications can also be quickly and easily delivered to many organisations such as 
      * Branch office 
      * Outsourced 
      * Offshore employees 
      * Mobile workers using iPad and Android tablets.

# Container
## 1. What is Container?
* Container in cloud computing is an approach to operating system virtualization.  Through this, the user can work with a program and its dependencies using resource procedures that are isolated. It is used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and environmental consistency.
  * The important thing to recognize with cloud containers is that they are designed to virtualize a single application for e.g., you have a MySQL container and that's all it does, provide a virtual instance of that application. Containers create an isolation boundary at the application level rather than at the server level. 
  * They are able to run virtually on any operating system, greatly easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.
  * Containers are a solution to the issue of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another.   * This service could be from a laptop to a test environment, from a staging environment into production, and perhaps from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.
  * Containers in cloud computing have evolved from a security point of view.
## 2. How do we use container?
*  First simply put, a container consists of an entire runtime environment with an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By this the application platform and its dependencies, differences in OS distributions and used infrastructure are abstracted away. 
* They rely on virtual isolation to deploy applications that access a shared operating system without the need for virtual machines. Containers hold components such as files, libraries and environment variables required to run desired software.
* Containers create an isolation boundary at the application level not at the server level. By isolation it means that if anything goes wrong in that oe container (e.g., excessive consumption of resources) it only affects that individual container and not the whole VM or server. It also eleminates compatibility problems between containerized applications.
## 3. Which are the service providers offering containers? 
* Major cloud service providers which have offered containers as a service products are:-
  * Amazon Elastic Container Service
  * AWS Fargate
  * Google Kubernetes Engine
  * Microsoft Azure Container Instances (ACI)
  * Azure Kubernetes Service
  * IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
* They can also be deployed on public or private cloud infrastructure without the use of dedicated products from a cloud service provider.
