# About AWS 

## AWS:
 - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.
 - In AWS you get all 160 cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis. This means that you pay only for the services you use.

## Advantage of AWS:
 - 1.The applications are reliable because they run on a safe and reliable infrastructure.
 - 2.Their on-demand infrastructure allows greater scalability.
 - 3.The design options available on the cloud permit large flexibility.

## AWS Services:
### Amazon S3:
  - This tool is used for internet back up, and it's the cheapest storage option in the object-storage category. The best part: you can retrieve stored data from almost anywhere whenever you need it.
### AWS Data Transfer Products:
  - As the name suggests, these are migration, data collection, and data transfer products that help you collect data seamlessly. They also enable you to monitor and analyze data in real-time.
### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
  - This provides a secure and resizable computing capacity based on your needs. The service is designed to make web-scale cloud computing more accessible.
### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Services):
  - This is a notification tool that delivers messages to a large number of subscribers through email or SMS. You can send alarms, service notifications, and other messages intended to call attention to important information.
### Amazon KMS (Key Management System):
  - This is a security tool that uses 256-bit encryption for your data. It also safeguards it from hackers and cyber attacks.
### Amazon Lambda:
  - This service runs your code depending on specific events and manages the dependent resources. You need neither managing nor provisioning servers, and how much you pay depends on how long it takes to execute your code. It saves a lot of money compared with services that charge hourly rates.
### Route 53:
  - This is a DNS service in the cloud that doesn't require you to maintain a separate DNS account. It's designed to provide businesses with a reliable and cost-effective method to route users to internet applications.

## AWS presence:
 - It has a presence in over 190 countries and more than 100,000 active customers.
 - AWS now spans 76 Availability Zones within 24 geographic regions around the world.

## AWS features:
### Flexibility:
  - The difference between AWS and traditional IT models is flexibility.
  - The traditional models used to deliver IT solutions that require large investments in a new architecture, programming languages, and operating system.
  - The flexibility of AWS allows us to choose which programming models, languages, and operating systems are better suited for their project, so we do not have to learn new skills to adopt new technologies.
  - Building applications in aws are like building applications using existing hardware resources.
  - The flexibility of aws is a great asset for organizations to deliver the product with updated technology in time, and overall enhancing the productivity.
### Cost-effective:
  - AWS provides no upfront investment, long-term commitment, or minimum spend.
  - You can scale up or scale down as the demand for resources increases or decreases respectively.
  - An aws allows you to access the resources more instantly. It has the ability to respond the changes more quickly, and no matter whether the changes are large or small, means that we can take new opportunities to meet the business challenges that could increase the revenue, and reduce the cost.
### Scalable and elastic:
  - Scalability in aws has the ability to scale the computing resources up or down when demand increases or decreases respectively.
  - Elasticity in aws is defined as the distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple targets such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.
  - Elasticity load balancing and scalability automatically scale your AWS computing resources to meet unexpected demand and scale down automatically when demand decreases.
  - The aws cloud is also useful for implementing short-term jobs, mission-critical jobs, and the jobs repeated at the regular intervals.
### Secure:
  - AWS provides a scalable cloud-computing platform that provides customers with end-to-end security and end-to-end privacy.
  - AWS incorporates the security into its services, and documents to describe how to use the security features.
  - AWS maintains confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data which is the utmost importance of the aws.

## AWS benifits over other platforms:
### Location:
  - Despite its relatively humble beginnings,AWS has grown to be the worldwide leader in cloud computing. It now operates 44 availability zones within 16 geographic regions around the world. There are also 14 more availability zones in the works, along with five more regions including  China. So whatever your geographic preference, AWS has you covered.
### Automated Multi-Region Backups:
  - AWS offers various backup methods including AMIs and EBS snapshots. And the decentralized nature and global reach of AWS makes it easy and affordable to store critical information in multiple geographic locations. So if your primary production environment is taken offline due to a natural or manmade disaster, the backup data won’t be affected. And third-party services such as CloudRanger simplify the process even further, allowing businesses to automatically schedule backups across AWS regions without the need for in-house scripting (more on that later).
### Streamlined Disaster Recovery:
  - For some businesses, even a small amount of downtime or data loss spells disaster. For others, the cost of (limited) downtime/data loss does not outweigh the cost of maintaining a multi-site/Hot Standby recovery method. But whatever your business’s tolerance for downtime/data loss may be, AWS’s versatile platform can provide you with the right tools for your disaster recovery plan. And third-party services such as CloudRanger can also simplify your AWS disaster recovery by quickly restoring your data across multiple regions in the event of a disaster.
### Consistency & Reliability:
  - While AWS is an extremely useful platform for backups and disaster recovery, it is also extremely reliable. Despite a high-profile outage earlier this year, an independent review found that since 2015, AWS has been “far better at keeping its public cloud service running than either Microsoft or Google.” It also found that 40 percent of the platform’s total downtime during the same time period was tied to a single outage.
### Customization:
  - But the flexibility of AWS doesn’t stop there. The platform also allows for a high level of customization to meet the needs of individual businesses. For example, customer-defined tagging allows users to easily monitor and manage resources. From cost tracking and security to organization and automation, there’s virtually no limit to how or why customizable AWS tags can be utilized.
### Third Party APIs:
  - In keeping with the overall flexibility of the platform, AWS API means you can manage your cloud-based infrastructure in various programming languages. It also means that various third-party services like CloudRanger are available to help you utilize all of the time-and-cost-saving features AWS has to offer. From automated backups to EC2 and RDS instances, CloudRanger can help you automate routine yet necessary AWS tasks without the need for scripting.
