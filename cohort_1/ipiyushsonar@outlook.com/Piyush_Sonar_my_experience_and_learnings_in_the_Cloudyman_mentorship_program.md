## **1. What is _Cloud Computing_?**
#### _Cloud computing_ is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

## **2. Why we use _Cloud Computing_?**
#### Accessibility; _Cloud computing_ facilitates the access of applications and data from any location worldwide and any device with an internet connection. Cost savings; _Cloud computing_ offers businesses with scalable computing resources hence saving them on the cost of acquiring and maintaining them.

## **3. What is _GitHub_ and why we use it?**
#### _GitHub_ is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. The service can do this by using git, a revision control system that runs in the command line interface.

#### Using _GitHub_ makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work. If you aren't already using _GitHub_ for your coding projects, here are a few reasons to consider doing so.

## **4. Is it helpful for interview or placement?**
#### Yes, it is helpful for interview and placement. Because knowing having variety is the skillsets other than programming languages works to our advantages and sets us apart and makes us unique from the crowds of other candidates.

## **5. What are markup and markdown languages?**
####  Markup is the programming language which uses markup elements, such as `<body>`, `<div>`, etc. to define the layout of pages and also uses other markup elements, such as , to give pages contents. HTML and XML are two widely used flavors of Markup languages in creating web pages.

```html
/*HTML Example*/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```xml
/*XML Example*/
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
</xs:schema>
```
#### Markdown is a lightweight Markup language which allows users to write using (almost!) plain text to convert text to HTML/XHTML by John Gruber. According to him, Markdown is not meant to replace Markup, such as, Instead, it is just a very small subset of HTML tags to make users easy to read, write and edit web pages. By addressing this, Markdown is specified to be able to do block elements, such as paragraphs and line breaks, code blocks and span elements, such as links and images.

```md
This is an H1
=============

## This is an H2

_italic_

__bold__

[link](http://localhost:4000/)
```

## **6. What is the Centralized Computing?** 
#### Centralized computing is a type of computing architecture where all or most of the processing/computing is performed on a central server. ... The central server, in turn, is responsible for delivering application logic, processing, and providing computing resources (both basic and complex) to the attached client machines.
