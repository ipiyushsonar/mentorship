# Basic definition of *Cloud computing* 
#### Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.


# More about *cloud computing*
- #### You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you use an online service to send an email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. 
- #### The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations—from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits—are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons.


# What is *GitHub* and why we use *Github*?
- #### GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
- #### It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. GitHub offers plans free of charge, and professional and enterprise accounts. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects.


# Why cloud computing and Github is helpful to crack interviews and placement opportunity?
- #### Cloud computing provides on-demand access to virtualized IT resources. It can be used by the subscriber. It uses a shared pool to provide configurable resources. The shared pool contains networks, servers, storage, applications and services.
- #### GitHub is mostly used by a programmer for developing computer codes. GitHub offers distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of GIT along with add-on features. GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

# What are markup and markdown language?
- #### Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.
- #### Markdown Support Markdown is a lightweight markup language for adding formatting elements to plain text. ... The Markdown editor helps you to perform basic editing capabilities: manage headings, apply formatting to text to make it bold or italic, and so on.]
- #### A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. ... XML is called the "Extensible Markup Language" since custom tags can be used to support a wide range of elements.


# What is a centralized system?
#### Centralized systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations where the client sends a request to a company server and receives the response.
