 ## *Capital Expenditure (CapEx)*
 
 #### CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, 
 #### such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment. Some examples of IT items that fall under
 #### this category would be whole systems and servers, printers and scanners, or air conditioners and generators.
 #### You buy these items once and they benefit your business for many, many years. Maintenance of such
 #### items is also considered CapEx, as it extends their lifetime and usefulness.
 
 ## *Operational Expenditure (OpEx)*
 
 #### OpEx is your operating costs, the expenses to run day-to-day business, like services and consumable items
 #### that get used up and are paid for according to use. This includes printer cartridges and paper, electricity,
 #### and even yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations. These things are necessary for your 
 #### businessâ€™s success but are not considered major long-term investments like CapEx items.
