## What is Cloud Computing?
*Cloud Computing is the technique in which large number of servers are running to perform data processing task, centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources*
## Why We Need Cloud Computing?
*We Learned this topic with the example like we have one application for our organization and we have to run it fluently without any lag so basically many Problems may occur without cloud computing scenario like we have not enough space and RAM to run that application without any lag...so here is the cloud computing thing comes into the picture now we will use cloud server or machine to run that software and run it virtually on cloud server*
## I am a programmer, I don't need to learn cloud computing?
*till now we learned many programming languages like c,c++, python but we just compile the code and run it thats it so our work finished but in industry level we need to deploy our code on cloud and we have think about time complexity , space complexity,etc because thousands of people are accessing code at same time thats why programmer also need to learn about Cloud Computing*
## What is GitHub? Why should I use it? 
*GitHub as an application we can use to store our code on the web. For Example - We have team which is working in same code from many days but eventually some prblem occurs and code get destroyed so its very harmful for our organization.thats why we need github.
we may use it for something as simple as free cloud storage for our projects, or we may use it to show your code to potential employers interested in assessing your coding skills*

## How to use GitHub Repository and how to pull request any information?
*A repository is like a folder for our project. out project's repository contains all of our project's files and stores each file's revision history. we can also discuss and manage our project's work within the repository
we can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility*
*  *Pool Request is it tells owner and others about you have did some changes or added some data in repository and owner has access to approve or disapprove the pool request*


## What is markup and markdown language?
*Markup Language is used for annotate text and embed tags.
For e.g - HTML(Hyper Text Mark-up Language)Whuch is used for web designing.
Markdown Language is used for documents designing and for formatting text in documents*
