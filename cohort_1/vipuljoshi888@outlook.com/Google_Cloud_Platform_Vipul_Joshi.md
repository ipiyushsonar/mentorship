# What is Google Cloud Platform?
- Google Cloud Platform is essentially a public cloud-based machine whose services are delivered to customers on an as-you-go basis, by way of service components.
A public cloud lets you leverage its resources to empower the applications you build, as well as to reach a broader base of customers.
# Features Of Google Cloud Platform
- Manage VM's - Managed VMs are sort of an in-between IaaS and PaaS service. They can be programmed to boot up with a specific guest OS, with specific applications ready to go and they can be changed on the fly.
- Replica Pools - Another nifty trick Google uses is named Replica Pools. It’s similar to the idea of Managed VMs, but Replica Pools take it a step further and allow a user to make copies of existing virtual machine automatically. It’s basically a copy and paste button for VMs
- Kubernets - Google is embarcing all types fo technology beyond the VM though. Specifically, the company uses a lot of containers. According to Julia Ferraioli, a developer advocate at Google - almost all of the company’s products, including search, Gmail and its cloud services, all heavily use containers. She says the company creates more than 2 billion containers every week.
