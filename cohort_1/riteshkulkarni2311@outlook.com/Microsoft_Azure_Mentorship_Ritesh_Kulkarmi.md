# Microsft Azure

- > - Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud 
services,including compute, analytics, storage and networking.Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new
applications,or run existing applications in the public cloud.
- > - Microsoft Azureis a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying,and managing application
andservices through Microsoft-managed data centers.
- > - It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many
different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.
- > - Azure was announced in October 2008, started with codename "Project Red Dog",[1] and released on February 1, 2010, as 
"Windows Azure" before being renamed "Microsoft Azure" on March 25, 2014

> ## Design

- > - Microsoft Azure uses a specialized operating system, called Microsoft Azure, to run its "fabric layer" A cluster hosted at
Microsoft's datacenters that manage computing and storage resources of the computers and provisions the resources (or a subset of them
to applicationsrunning on top of Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure has been described as a "cloud layer" on top of a number of Windows
Server systems,which use Windows Server 2008 and a customized version of Hyper-V, known as the Microsoft Azure Hypervisor to provide 
virtualization of services.

- > - Scaling and reliability are controlled by the Microsoft Azure Fabric Controller, which ensures the services and environment do
not fail if one or more of the servers fails within the Microsoft data center, and which also provides the management of the user's 
Webapplication such as memory allocation and load balancing.

- > - Azure provides an API built on REST, HTTP, and XML that allows a developer to interact with the services provided by Microsoft 
Azure.Microsoft also provides a client-side managed class library that encapsulates the functions of interacting with the services. 
It alsointegrates with Microsoft Visual Studio, Git, and Eclipse.

- > - In addition to interacting with services via API, users can manage Azure services using the Web-based Azure Portal, which reached
General Availability in December 2015. The portal allows users to browse active resources, modify settings, launch new resources, 
and view basic monitoring data from active virtual machines and services.
