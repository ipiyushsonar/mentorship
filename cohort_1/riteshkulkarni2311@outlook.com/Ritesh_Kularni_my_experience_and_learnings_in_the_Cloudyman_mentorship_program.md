# Cloud computing :
- >	- Reduced spending on Technology Infrastructure and Capital Costs.  When you move your data into the cloud you will no longer need to invest in the expensive hardware and software (such as servers, storage and firewalls) needed to maintain your network.   Once your business is housed in a cloud environment these expenses are covered by your IT provider, with lower power costs and increased storage capacity for you. In addition you will not need to invest in additional hardware to safeguard your data against disaster; these costs are also absorbed by your provider. And as an added bonus, you can be sure that your cloud provider has invested in the most secure, up-to-date equipment available because his/her business depends upon it!

- >	- Low Monthly Overhead with Reduced Software and Upgrade Expenses. Cloud computing is commonly known as SaaS (Software as a Service); simply put you will only pay for the use of a software application without the need to purchase it outright.  In a cloud computing environment you will  be paying a subscription fee for each software application you need with all upgrades included in that monthly cost. This allows you to select the highest quality software applications available without the financial investment needed to purchase them.

- > -	Highly Skilled IT Support with Predictable Costs and Fees. Even if you are already using an outsourced IT provider you will find additional cost benefits when you move your platform to the cloud. Managed Service Providers who specialize in cloud support are able to offer highly-skilled, efficient troubleshooting and maintenance that reduces your need to invest in in-house tech support, lowering your company’s payroll costs. In addition to benefiting from your providers expertise and the peace of mind it provides you will be able to predictably account for the costs and fees associated with your service.  No more add-ons that you weren’t expecting!

- > -	Greater efficiency and productivity from your workforce. Once you have moved your business into the cloud your employees will be able to access your network and applications from virtually any device (smartphone, tablet, desktops) and virtually any place (airports, hotels, restaurants) where they can access the internet. With a well-designed cloud platform you can expect that your employees will have the flexibility to work outside of a normal business hours schedule and location; adding productivity and efficiency improvements to your company’s bottom line.
