Today I learned about the basics of Github like what is pull request,merge request,propose request

the speaker explained the uses of request and how to they are helpfull in companies

> Today I learned about cloud computing and its Benfits like cost,security,flexebilty etc

# Cloud Computing

### Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale

# Benefits Of Cloud Computing

### Consider an example for understanding its benefit, If I wants to start a company of designing things then I have to buy minimum 5 computer of high specfications for work of designing products.Consider the budget is 10lac for starting my company and cost of one computer is approximately 1.5lac then buying 5 means spending 75% of my money only on computers. Instead of this I can just get all those specification on rent by using Cloud Computing (***COST SAVING***) by paying nearly 10K on each computer for a month.What I have to do is only buy a computer of minimum specifictions and contact any of the Cloud Company Like Google,Amazon,IBM etc they will give me a Remote Connection Desktop and using this Remote Connection Desktop I can esatiblish its connection wherever I want (***MOBILITY***) with the specifications I needed (***FLEXIBILITY***)and does not depend on which computer you are using,by doing this I have save most of my money.If company is on demand I can add Cloud and if its not then I can remove the cloud ,can make change in its specifiaction at any time accordingly.And Cloud companies also provide Security,Internet etc.Based on this Example benefits are listed below

- ### Cost Saving
  Instead buying computers of high specfictions, buy it on rent using Cloud Computing and pay only when you use it, means if you want to use for a month and skip the next month then pay only for the month you use it.

- ### Security
  Most of the security is provided by the Cloud itself.But it also depends on the user as if the user provided its details to other like Remote Acess Pin that is the IP address and the password then the security issue is with the user not with the cloud. Suppose if power went off and you forgot to save your data you can get your data back as  your data is already saved on cloud . So no need to worry about the data loss
  
- ### Flexibility
    In the terms of Cloud Computing it means you can change the specfications whenever you needed,that is change the Ram,processor specifications etc also if you need to add or remove the cloud from any of the machine 

- ### Mobility
  This means you can access your data from any geographical area with help of IP address.Enter the IP address on any computer and all the data that is saved on the cloud appers there on the Computer   

- ### Insight
  It will provide all the knowldege in depth you need to know about the cloud 

- ### Increased Collaboration
  Cloud collaboration's power lies in allowing people to work together on documents, or other data types, simultaneously. The advantage of cloud collaboration is that it allows people to share and edit projects at the same time across many different locations
  
- ### Quality Control

- ### Disaster Recovery

- ### Loss Prevention

- ### Automatic Software Updates

- ### Competitive Edge

- ### Sustainability
