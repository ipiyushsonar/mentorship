Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have
evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.
First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented 
on. There are four different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or community cloud

## Public Cloud 
  With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. 
In a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage, and network devices with other organizations or cloud tenants(where a server
host one coustomer, who has sole access). You access services and manage your account using a web browser. Public cloud deployments are 
frequently used to provide web-based email, online office applications, storage, and testing and development environments.The data can be 
stored at any place

## Advantages of public clouds:
- Lower costs—no need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use.
- No maintenance—your service provider provides the maintenance.
- Near-unlimited scalability—on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
- High reliability—a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

## Private Cloud
  A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically 
located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the 
services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your 
organization. In this way, a private cloud can make it easier for an organization to customize its resources to meet specific IT 
requirements. Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions, any other mid- to large-size organizations 
with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.

## Advantages of a private clouds:
- More flexibility—your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
- Improved security—resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and security are possible.
- High scalability—private clouds still afford the scalability and efficiency of a public cloud.

## Hybrid Cloud
  Often called “the best of both worlds,” hybrid clouds combine on-premises infrastructure, or private clouds, with public clouds so 
organizations can reap the advantages of both. In a hybrid cloud, data and applications can move between private and public clouds for 
greater flexibility and more deployment options. For instance, you can use the public cloud for high-volume, lower-security needs such 
as web-based email, and the private cloud (or other on-premises infrastructure) for sensitive, business-critical operations like 
financial reporting. In a hybrid cloud, “cloud bursting” is also an option. This is when an application or resource runs in the private 
cloud until there is a spike in demand (such as seasonal event like online shopping or tax filing), at which point the organization can 
“burst through” to the public cloud to tap into additional computing resources.

## Advantages of hybrid clouds:
- Control—your organization can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets.
- Flexibility—you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
- Cost-effectiveness—with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.

## Community Cloud
  A community cloud in computing is a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a 
specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party and 
hosted internally or externally. This is controlled and used by a group of organizations that have shared interest.

## Advantages of community cloud:

- Cost effective -Community cloud is cost effective because the whole cloud is shared between several organizations or a community.
- Flexible and Scalable- The community cloud is flexible and scalable because it is compatible with every user. It allows the users to 
modify the documents as per their needs and requirement.
- Security- Community cloud is more secure than the public cloud but less secure than the private cloud.
- Sharing Infrastructure- Community cloud allows us to share cloud resources, infrastructure, and other capabilities among various 
organizations.

# Types of Cloud Services
Most cloud computing services fall into three broad categories: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), 
Serverless and Software as a service (SaaS)

- # Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it.

# - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS includes infrastructure—servers, storage, and networking—but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) 
services, database management systems, and more. PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, 
deploying, managing, and updating.Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with 
resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. 
You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet 
connection.

# - Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet.SaaS provides a complete software 
solution.It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the 
help of internet connection and web browser.
