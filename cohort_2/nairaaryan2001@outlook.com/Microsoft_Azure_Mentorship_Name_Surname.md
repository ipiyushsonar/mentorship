# What is Azure?

- Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organisation meet your business challenges. It is the freedom to build, manage and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

# Cloud Deployment Model:-

- To start with, there are many different models for deployment in cloud computing to choose from. Your cloud infrastructure and placement of each workload depend on your business needsâ€”for example, balancing short-term costs with long-term total cost of ownership (TCO), addressing any data governance regulations, and ensuring uptime for mission-critical applications

# There are four cloud deployment models:-

## 1.Public cloud:-

- The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.


## 2.Private cloud:-

- A virtual private cloud is an on-demand configurable pool of shared computing resources allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation between the different organizations using the 


## 3.Community cloud:-

- A community cloud in computing is a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally.


## 4.Hybrid cloud:-

- Hybrid cloud is a solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service. A hybrid cloud strategy provides businesses with greater flexibility by moving workloads between cloud solutions as needs and costs fluctuate.

# What is Fault Domain?

- A fault domain is a set of hardware components that share a single point of failure. To be fault tolerant to a certain level, you need multiple fault domains at that level. For example, to be rack fault tolerant, your servers and your data must be distributed across multiple racks.

# What is update Domain?

- Update Domains. Virtual machines get update domains automatically once they are put inside availability set. All virtual machines within that update domain will reboot together. Update domains are used for patching of the virtual machines.
