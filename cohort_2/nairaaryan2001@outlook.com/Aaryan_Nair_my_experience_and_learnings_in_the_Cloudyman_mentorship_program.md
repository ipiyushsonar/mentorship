# What is markdown?


- Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. ... Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

- It was developed by
John Gruber (in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax)


# What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change

# History of Cloud Computing:-

- Cloud computing as a term has been around since the early 2000s, but the concept of computing-as-a-service has been around for much, much longer -- as far back as the 1960s, when computer bureaus would allow companies to rent time on a mainframe, rather than have to buy one themselves.

- These 'time-sharing' services were largely overtaken by the rise of the PC which made owning a computer much more affordable, and then in turn by the rise of corporate data centers where companies would store vast amounts of data.

- But the concept of renting access to computing power has resurfaced again and again in the application service providers, utility computing, and grid computing of the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was followed by cloud computing, which really took hold with the emergence of software as a service and hyperscale cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services.

# Types of Cloud Computing:-

- The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. 

## 1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):-


IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. 

## 2.Platform as a Service (PaaS):-


PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

## 3.Software as a Service (SaaS):-


SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.

# Virtual Machine:-

A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself.

# Benefits of Cloud Computing:-


## 1.Cost Savings:-


Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing.The services are free from capital expenditure. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. 

## 2.Security:-


Cloud computing offers great security when any sensitive data has been lost. As the data is stored in the system, it can be easily accessed even if something happens to your computer. You can even remotely wipe out data from the lost machines for avoiding it getting in the wrong hands.

## 3.Flexibility:-


It offers flexible facility which could be turned off, up or down as per the circumstances of the user. For instance, a promotion of sales is very popular, capacity can be immediately and quickly added to it for the avoidance of losing sales and crashing servers. When those sales are done, the capacity can also be shrunk for the reduction of costs.

## 4.Mobility:-


Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.

## 5.Insight:-


When cloud provider provisions fundamental computing resources such as networks, processing, and storage, it is understood that the consumer has hardly any control on underlying physical infrastructure of cloud. Consumer of these resources is able to control deployed applications, operating systems, storage and to networking components to some extent.
  
## 6.Increased Collaboration:-


Cloud collaboration is a type of enterprise collaboration that allows employees to work together on documents and other data types, which are stored off-premises and outside of the company firewall. ... Cloud collaboration enables two or more people to work on a project at once.

## 7.Disaster Recovery:-


The primary goal of disaster recovery is to minimize the overall impact of a disaster on business performance. Disaster recovery in cloud computing can do just that. In case of disaster, critical workloads can be failed over to a DR site in order to resume business operations. As soon as your production data center gets restored, you can fail back from the cloud and restore your infrastructure and its components to their original state. As a result, business downtime is reduced and service disruption is minimized.

## 8.Automatic Software Updates:-


Automatic software updates; Cloud providers usually provide a cloud service model known as Software as a Service (SaaS). One of the benefits of this model is that it ensures that software vendors take care of regular software and security updates on behalf of the users.

## 9.Competitive Edge:-


The ability to analyze big data in cloud systems creates competitive advantage from cloud computing through access and affordability of complex software for small and medium sized enterprises. ... In addition, current cloud big data analytics systems do not require sophisticated technical expertise to perform calculations

## 10.Sustainability:-


The keys to a sustainable cloud are sourcing renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. If the cloud is located in areas that source renewable power, cloud computing can not only save billions of dollars in energy costs it can also reduce carbon emissions by millions of metric tons.
