Today the speaker has explained us the purpose of learning cloud computing.

##### cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources.

Here are seven common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:
- cost  
- speed  
- global scale  
- productivity  
- performance  
- reliability  
- security

# Types of cloud computing

Not all clouds are the same and not ontype of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.

First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud.

# Virtual machine definition

##### Ans.

Virtual machines are software computers that provide the same functionality as physical computers. Like physical computers, they run applications and an operating system. However, virtual machines are computer files that run on a physical computer and behave like a physical computer. In other words, virtual machines behave as separate computer systems.

# Why Virtual Machines?

##### Ans.

Virtual machines are created to perform specific tasks that are risky to perform in a host environment, such as accessing virus-infected data and testing operating systems. Since the virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, the software inside the virtual machine cannot tamper with the host computer. Virtual machines can also be used for other purposes such as server virtualization.

# Benefits of cloud computing

### Flexibility

Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.

### Cost savings

Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. You may be able to reduce your operating costs because:

- the cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract
- you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff
- your energy consumption costs may be reduced
- there are fewer time delays.

### Increased collaboration

Collaboration in a cloud environment gives your business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files. You could also choose a cloud computing model that makes it easy for you to share your records with your advisers (e.g. a quick and secure way to share accounting records with your accountant or financial adviser).

### Automatic software updates

Access to automatic updates for your IT requirements may be included in your service fee. Depending on your cloud computing service provider, your system will regularly be updated with the latest technology. This could include up-to-date versions of software, as well as upgrades to servers and computer processing power.

# What is Microsoft Azure? 

##### Ans.

Microsoft has leveraged its constantly-expanding worldwide network of data centers to create Azure, a cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing services and applications, anywhere. Azure lets you add cloud capabilities to your existing network through its platform as a service (PaaS) model, or entrust Microsoft with all of your computing and network needs with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Either option provides secure, reliable access to your cloud hosted data—one built on Microsoft’s proven architecture.

Azure provides an ever expanding array of products and services designed to meet all your needs through one convenient, easy to manage platform. Below are just some of the capabilities Microsoft offers through Azure and tips for determining if the Microsoft cloud is the right choice for your organization.

# Logging capabilities within Microsoft Azure

The secret gold mine of any infrastructure and service solution is ongoing operational and security visibility, and ultimately these comes down to extracting critical log and infrastructure metrics from the application and underlying stack. The lack of this visibility is like flying a plane blind—no one does it. Azure comes with integrated health monitoring and alert capabilities so you can know in an instant if performance issues or outages are impacting your business. Set smart alert levels for events from:

## Azure diagnostic infrastructure logs

Get current insights into how your cloud network is performing and take action to resolve slow downs, bottlenecks, or service failures.

## Windows IIS logs

View activity on your virtual web servers and respond to traffic patterns or log-in anomalies with the data Azure gathers on IIS 7.

## Crash dumps

Even virtual machines can ‘blue screen’ and other virtual equipment crashes can majorly disrupt your operations. With Microsoft Azure you can record crash dump data and troubleshoot to avoid repeat problems.

## Custom error logs

Set Azure alerts to inform you about defined error events. This is especially helpful when hosting private applications that generate internal intelligence about operations, so you can add these errors to the health checklist Azure maintains about your network.

# How Azure works

Microsoft Azure is a private and public cloud platform. You may be familiar with Azure services. But, how does it work?

Azure uses a technology known as virtualization, a priori, nothing new up to this point.

Virtualization separates the close coupling between a computer’s CPU or server and its operating system by means of an abstraction layer called a hypervisor. The hypervisor emulates all the functions of a real computer or server and its CPU in a virtual machine. You can run multiple virtual machines at the same time and each virtual machine can run any compatible operating system such as Windows or Linux.

Azure takes this virtualization technology and rethinks it on a massive scale in Microsoft data centres around the world.

Therefore, the cloud is a set of physical servers in one or several data centres that run virtualized hardware on behalf of clients.

## Benefits of Azure

- Free start and scale as per your need
- Infrastructure as per need
- Cloud platform of enterprise level
- Valuable data insights
- Encode, Protect, Stream and Ingesting facility for applications
