### *Cloud Computing Deployment Models*

> ## Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud computing are as follows:

- Public cloud As the name suggests, this type of cloud deployment model supports all users who want to make use of a 
computing resource, such as hardware (OS, CPU, memory, storage) or software 
(application server, database) on a subscription basis. Most common uses of public clouds are for application development and testing, non-mission-critical tasks such as file-sharing, and e-mail service.

- Private cloud True to its name, a private cloud is typically infrastructure used by a single organization. Such infrastructure may be managed by
the organization itself to support various user groups, or it could be managed by a service provider that takes care of it either 
on-site or off-site. Private clouds are more expensive than public clouds due to the capital expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining them. However, private clouds are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today.

- Hybrid cloud In a hybrid cloud, an organization makes use of interconnected private and public cloud infrastructure. Many organizations make use of this model when they need to scale up their IT infrastructure rapidly, such as when leveraging public clouds to supplement the capacity available within a private cloud. For example, if an online retailer needs more computing resources to run its Web applications during the holiday season it may attain those resources via public clouds.

- Community cloud This deployment model supports multiple organizations sharing computing resources that are part of a community; examples include universities cooperating in certain areas of research, or police departments within a county or state sharing computing resources. Access to a community cloud environment is typically restricted to the members of the community.
