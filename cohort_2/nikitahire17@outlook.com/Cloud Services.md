# **What are the Types of Cloud Services** 

> <p>Cloud computing services fall into 4 categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and FaaS (functions as a service). These are sometimes called the cloud computing stack, because they build on top of one another.</p>

 -  ###  Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
 
    IaaS is the most basic category of cloud computing services that allows you rent IT infrastructure (servers or VMâ€™s) from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

 -  ###  Platform as a service (PaaS)

    Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) refers to the supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. It is designed to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

 -  ### Software as a service (SaaS)

    Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet as per the demand and on a subscription basis. SaaS helps you host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance (software upgrades and security patching).
