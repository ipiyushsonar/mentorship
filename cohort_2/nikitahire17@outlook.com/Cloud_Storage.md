## What is Cloud Storage?
 
> Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and 
operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and
managing your own data storage infrastructure.This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access.

## Benefits of Cloud Storage

> Storing data in the cloud lets IT departments transform three areas:

>>   **Total Cost of Ownership** With cloud storage, there is no hardware to purchase, storage to provision, or capital being used for "someday" scenarios. You can add or remove capacity on demand, quickly change performance and retention characteristics, and only pay for storage that you actually use. Less frequently accessed data can even be automatically moved to lower cost tiers in accordance with auditable rules, driving economies of scale.

>>   **Time to Deployment** When development teams are ready to execute, infrastructure should never slow them down. Cloud storage allows IT to quickly deliver the exact amount of storage needed, right when it's needed. This allows IT to focus on solving complex application problems instead of having to manage storage systems.

>>   **Information Management** Centralizing storage in the cloud creates a tremendous leverage point for new use cases. By using cloud storage lifecycle management policies, you can perform powerful information management tasks including automated tiering or locking down data in support of compliance requirements. 

## Types of Cloud Storage
 
> There are three types of cloud data storage: object storage, file storage, and block storage. Each offers their own advantages and have their own use cases:

>>    **Object Storage-** Applications developed in the cloud often take advantage of object storage's vast scalablity and metadata characteristics. Object storage solutions like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) are ideal for building modern applications from scratch that require scale and flexibility, and can also be used to import existing data stores for analytics, backup, or archive.
    
>>    **File Storage-** Some applications need to access shared files and require a file system. This type of storage is often supported with a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases like large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories.
    
>>    **Block Storage-** Other enterprise applications like databases or ERP systems often require dedicated, low latency storage for each host. This is analagous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Block-based cloud storage solutions like Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) are provisioned with each virtual server and offer the ultra low latency required for high performance workloads.
