## What Is Cloud Computing? How Does ‘The Cloud’ Work?

<p> The term “cloud” when talking about technology or computing, is not new. In simple terms, ‘cloud’ is a metaphor for the Internet. In fact, cloud symbols are repeatedly used to depict the Internet on diagrams. If you think of the Internet as a virtual ‘space’ that connects users from all over the globe, it is like a cloud. It shares information by the way of networks.So, if we go back to the question of what cloud computing actually is, it refers to sharing resources, software and information through a network. In this case, via ‘the Internet’ or more correctly, an Internet connection. Information and data is stored on physical or virtual servers, which are maintained and controlled by a cloud computing provider, such as Amazon and their AWS product. As a personal or business cloud computing user, you access your stored information on the ‘cloud’, via an Internet connection.</p>

## What Are The Different Types Of Cloud Computing?
<p>
Cloud computing can mean many different things these days, but there’s three main categories of cloud computing services. You might have heard about these or use them already; Software as a Service (SaaS), for example – Microsoft 365, Platform as a Service (PaaS), example – salesforce.com and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), example – Rackspace.</p>

> - ## Benefits of cloud computing

>> Cloud computing offers your business many benefits. It allows you to set up what is essentially a virtual office to give you the flexibility of connecting to your business anywhere, any time. With the growing number of web-enabled devices used in today's business environment (e.g. smartphones, tablets), access to your data is even easier.

>> - There are many benefits to moving your business to the cloud:

**Reduced IT costs**

> Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. You may be able to reduce your operating costs because:

> the cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff your energy consumption costs may be reduced there are fewer time delays.

**Scalability**

> Your business can scale up or scale down your operation and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing flexibility as your needs change. Rather than purchasing and installing expensive upgrades yourself, your cloud computer service provider can handle this for you. Using the cloud frees up your time so you can get on with running your business.

**Business continuity**

> Protecting your data and systems is an important part of business continuity planning. Whether you experience a natural disaster, power failure or other crisis, having your data stored in the cloud ensures it is backed up and protected in a secure and safe location. Being able to access your data again quickly allows you to conduct business as usual, minimising any downtime and loss of productivity.

**Collaboration efficiency**

> Collaboration in a cloud environment gives your business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files. You could also choose a cloud computing model that makes it easy for you to share your records with your advisers (e.g. a quick and secure way to share accounting records with your accountant or financial adviser).

**Flexibility of work practices**

> Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.

**Access to automatic updates**

> Access to automatic updates for your IT requirements may be included in your service fee. Depending on your cloud computing service provider, your system will regularly be updated with the latest technology. This could include up-to-date versions of software, as well as upgrades to servers and computer processing power.
