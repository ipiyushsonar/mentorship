# ***CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS***

## Date : June 9, 2020

There are four types of them: public, private, hybrid and community clouds. Additionally, there are also distributed clouds, multiclouds, poly clouds and other models, but they are not so widespread.

A cloud deployment model is a specific configuration of environment parameters such as the accessibility and proprietorship of the deployment infrastructure and storage size. It means that deployment types vary depending on who controls the infrastructure and where it resides.

## **1. Public Cloud**

The name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers.

Server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage them and administer pool resources, which is why there is no need for user companies to buy and maintain their hardware. Provider companies offer resources as a service both free of charge or on a pay-per-use basis via the Internet connection. Users can scale resources when required.

The public cloud deployment model is the first choice for businesses that operate within the industries with low privacy concerns. When it comes to popular public cloud deployment models, examples are Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) — the top service provider, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, IBM Cloud, Salesforce Heroku and others.

### The Advantages of a Public Cloud :-

- **_Hassle-free infrastructure management._** Having a third party running your cloud infrastructure is convenient: you do not need to develop and maintain your software as the service provider does it for you. Also, the infrastructure setup and use are unsophisticated.

- **_High scalability._** You can easily extend the available capacity as your company requirements increase.

- **_Reduced costs._** You pay only for the service you use, no need to invest in hardware or software.

- **_24/7 uptime._** An extensive network of the provider’s servers ensures the constant availability of your infrastructure and its improved operation time.

### The Disadvantages of a Public Cloud :-

- **_Compromised reliability._** That same server network is also meant to ensure against failures. But often enough, public clouds experience outages and malfunction, as it was in the case of the Salesforce CRM disruption in 2016 that caused a storage collapse.

- **_Data security and privacy give rise to concern._** Although access to data is easy, a public deployment model deprives users of knowing where their information is kept and who has access to it.

- **_The lack of a bespoke service._** Service providers have only standardized service options, which is why they will probably fail to satisfy their requirements if they are unusual.

## **2. Private Cloud**

There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar. However, opposed to a public cloud that is available to the general public, only one specific company owns a private one. That is why it is also called an internal or corporate.

Only one organization uses this deployment model to run its workloads, and the server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the user company. Regardless of their physical location, these infrastructures are maintained on a designated private network and use software and hardware that are intended for a specific company.

### The Benefits of a Private Cloud :-

- Bespoke and flexible development and high scalability, which allows companies to customize their infrastructures in accordance with their requirements

- High security, privacy and reliability as only authorized persons can access resources

### The Drawbacks of a Private Cloud :-

- The major disadvantage of the private cloud deployment model is its cost, as it requires considerable expenses on hardware, software and staff training. That is why this secure and flexible computing deployment model is not a choice for small companies.

## **3. Community Cloud**

A community deployment model largely resembles a private one; the only difference is the set of users. While a private type implies that only one company owns the server, in the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.

If the organizations have uniform security, privacy and performance requirements, this multi-tenant data center architecture helps companies achieve their business-specific objectives. That is why a community model is particularly suited for organizations that work on joint projects. In that case, a centralized cloud facilitates project development, management and implementation. Also, the costs are shared across all users.

### The Strengths of a Community Cloud :-

- Cost reduction

- Improved security, privacy and reliability

- Ease of data sharing and collaboration

### The Shortcomings of a Community Cloud :-

- High cost if compared to a public deployment model

- Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity

- It is not widespread so far

## **4. Hybrid Cloud**

As it is usually the case with any hybrid phenomenon, a hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above-mentioned deployment models — public, private and community ones. It allows companies to mix and match the facets of all three types that best suit their requirements.

As an example, a company can balance its load by locating mission-critical workloads on a secure private cloud and deploying less sensitive ones to a public one. Hybrid cloud deployment model not only safeguards and controls strategically important assets but does so in the most cost- and resource-effective way possible for each specific case. Also, this approach facilitates data and application portability.

### The Benefits of a Hybrid Cloud :-

- Improved security and privacy

- Enhanced scalability and flexibility

- Reasonable price
