## what is Microsoft Azure?
![](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MicrosoftAzure.png)
   Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organisation meet your business challenges. It is the freedom to build, manage and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks
 
## Microsoft Azure why it is used?
   Microsoft has leveraged its constantly-expanding worldwide network of data centers to create Azure, a cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing services and applications, anywhere. Either option provides secure, reliable access to your cloud hosted dataâ€”one built on Microsoft's proven architecture
 
## How Microsoft Azure works?
   Microsoft Azure is a set of web scale cloud services that's wont to build, deploy, and manage applications through Microsoft's globally distributed network of knowledge centers. Its versatile platform are often wont to run applications on cloud or just improve existing applications with cloud capabilities
   
## Microsoft Azure Services:
   Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking.
   
### computer services:
   Azure computer is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources like multi-core processors and supercomputers via virtual machines and containers. It also provides serverless computing to run apps without requiring infrastructure setup or configuration
   
# services: 
   Cloud services, including Azure services, generally fall into three categories: IaaS, PaaS, or FaaS.It's useful to understand the differences.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) lets you provision individual VMs along with the associated networking and storage components. Then you deploy whatever software and applications you want onto those VMs. This model is the closest to a traditional on-premises environment, except that Microsoft manages the infrastructure. You still manage the individual VMs.

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provides a managed hosting environment, where you can deploy your application without needing to manage VMs or networking resources. Azure App Service is a PaaS service.

Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) goes even further in removing the need to worry about the hosting environment. In a FaaS model, you simply deploy your code and the service automatically runs it. Azure Functions are a FaaS service.

There is a spectrum from IaaS to pure PaaS. For example, Azure VMs can autoscale by using virtual machine scale sets. This automatic scaling capability isn't strictly PaaS, but it's the type of management feature found in PaaS services.

In general, there is a tradeoff between control and ease of management. IaaS gives the most control, flexibility, and portability, but you have to provision, configure and manage the VMs and network components you create. FaaS services automatically manage nearly all aspects of running an application. PaaS services fall somewhere in between
