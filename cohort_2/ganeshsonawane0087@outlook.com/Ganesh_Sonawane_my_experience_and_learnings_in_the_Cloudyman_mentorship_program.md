## what is cloud computing ?
![](https://aithority.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cloud-Computing-versus-Edge-Computing-staff-writeup.jpg)
  The technology of distributed dada processing  in which some scalable information resources and capabilities are provided as a service to multiple external  customers through internet  technology 
  Information and data  is stored  on physics or virtual  servers which are maintained and controlled by a cloud computing provider such as Amazon and their AWS provider 

## Benefits of cloud computing:-
  1. cost saving is the biggest  benefit of cloud computing 
  2. High speed 
  3. unlimited storage capacity 
  4. Automatic software integration
  5. Improved  compatibility between operating systems 
  6. collaboration  efficiency 
  7. Increase  scalability  and Reliability and many more...
  
## Applications of cloud computing 
  Clients would be able to access their applications and data from anywhere at any time They could access the cloud computing system using any computer linked to the internet 

## Example of cloud computing 
   Cloud computing  is a use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network 
   An example of cloud computing provider is Google's Gmail Gmail user can access files and applications hosted by Google via the internet from any device 

# Main features/Benefits  of cloud computing 
 
## cost saving:
   An advantage of cloud computing is reduction in hardware cost. Along with purchase cost, off-site  hardware cuts internal power cost and saves space 
   You can save  substantial capital costs through reduction in spending on equipment, infrastructure and software 
   The contract with most cloud service providers includes the costs of system upgrades, new hardware and software 

## security:
   There are  best benefits of cloud computing 
   1. Data Encryption
   2. Avoid DDoS Attacks
   3. Regulatory compliance 
   4. secure storage 
   5. Patch management 
   6. Flexibility 
   7. High availability and support 

## Flexibility and scalability:
   Cloud computing allows your employees  to be more flexible  both in and out of the work place Employees  can access Files using web enabled devices such as smartphones  laptops and notebooks 
   One of the best key benefits of using cloud computing is it's scalability Because of highly scalable nature of cloud computing this will allow you to support your business growth without expensive changes to your existing IT system 

## Mobility:
   The cloud  is the powerful mobility that cloud computing providers one of the benefits of cloud mobility is the ability to connect  better with the people It allows people to access mission- critical data  and software from anywhere anytime 

## Increased collaboration:
   Cloud computing is rapidly growing solution for issues related to data storage and collaboration 
   1. Improved organization,
   2. Higher participation levels 
   3. Improved access to large files 
   4. Real time updates 
   5. Better brainstorming 

## Disaster recovery 
   Data loss is a major concern for all organizations, along with data security If your  equipment like laptops or pc is damaged cloud based services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios from natural disaster to power outages

## Automatic software updates:
   Access to automatic updates for It requirement, Depending on your cloud  computing service provider your system will be regularly be updated with latest technology 

# Types of cloud computing 
  Cloud computing  can be broken up into three main services 
  1. Software-as-a-service (SaaS)
  2. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (LaaS)
  3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
  These three services make up what Rackspace calls the cloud computing Stack , with SaaS on top,PaaS in the middle and LaaS on the bottom 

# what is capex or opex in cloud computing?
  Cloud computing is accelerating this need based on the shift from capital expense to operating expenses. Capital expenses (CapEx) are for assets with a useful life greater than one year. Operating expenses (OpEx) are incurred in the ordinary course of running the business on a monthly or yearly basis.

## Difference between capex and opex
   An operating expense (OPEX) is an expense required for the day-to-day functioning of a business. In contrast, a capital expense (CAPEX) is an expense a business incurs to create a benefit in the future CapEx is the standard model of traditional IT procurement, while OpEx is how cloud computing services are procured. The two have very different implications for cost, control and operational flexibility
   
# cloud computing regions:
 Regions allow to you locate your cloud resources close to your customers both internal or external The closer your customer are to the region where your cloud resources are located, the faster and better their experience will be there 
 
## Google cloud regions:
 Google cloud platform is available in 22 regions and 61 zones A region is a specific geographical location where users can deploy cloud resources each region is an independent geographical area that consists of zones 
 
## Regions in AWS:
 In AWS there are 16 regions The AWS global infrastructure is currently comprised of 16 AWS regions worldwide and 42 availability  zones AWS maintains multiple geographic regions including in North America, south America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific and the middle east 
   
# Availability zones in azure 
![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/media/az-overview/az-graphic-two.png)
      An availability zones is high availability offering that products your applinces and data from data centers failures Availability zones are unique  physics location within an azure region  Each zone is made up of one or more data centers equipped with with independent power, cooling and networking 
 
# What is region pair?
  A region pair consists of two regions within the same geography Azure serialized platform updates across regional pairs ensuring that only one region in each pair updates at a time. Each Azure region is paired with another region within same geography, together making a regional pair
