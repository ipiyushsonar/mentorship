  There are four cloud deployment models: public, private, community, and hybrid. Each deployment model is defined according to where the infrastructure for the environment is located. There are three main cloud service models: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service.
  
# what is deployment in cloud?
  Deployment to the Cloud. Cloud deployment refers to the enablement of SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (platform as a service) or IaaS (infrastructure as a service) solutions that may be accessed on demand by end users or consumers
  
# public cloud:
  public cloud is the cloud deployment model supports all users who want to make use of a computing resource, such as hardware (OS, CPU, memory, storage) or software (application server, database) on a subscription basis. Most common uses of public clouds are for application development and testing,
  
# private cloud:
 private cloud is typically infrastructure used by a single organization. Such infrastructure may be managed by the organization itself to support various user groups 
 Private clouds are more expensive than public clouds due to the capital expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining them. However, private clouds are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today
 
# Hybrid cloud:
 In a hybrid cloud, an organization makes use of interconnected private and public cloud infrastructure for example, if an online retailer needs more computing resources to run its Web applications during the holiday season it may attain those resources via public clouds.
 
# community cloud:
  This deployment model supports multiple organizations sharing computing resources that are part of a community; examples include universities cooperating in certain areas of research, or police departments within a county or state sharing computing resources
  
 A community cloud is a multi-tenant platform which allows several companies work on the same platform, given that they have similar needs and concerns. One example of using a community cloud would be to test-drive some high-end security products or even test out some features of a public cloud environment
