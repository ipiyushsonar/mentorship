  virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination
   
  Virtual Machine Definition Virtual machines are software computers that provide the same functionality as physical computers. Like physical computers, they run applications and an operating system. However, virtual machines are computer files that run on a physical computer and behave like a physical computer. 
  
  A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage    
   
## virtual machine used for:
   Virtual machines allow you to run an operating system in an app window on your desktop that behaves like a full, separate computer. You can use them play around with different operating systems, run software your main operating system can't, and try out apps in a safe, sandboxed environment  
   
## working of virtual machine:
   In server virtualization in Cloud Computing, the software directly installs on the server system and use for a single physical server can divide into many servers on the demand basis and balance the load. ... With the help of software, the server administrator divides one physical server into multiple servers.
   
##  Example of virtual machine:
   Examples of virtualization platforms adapted to such hardware include KVM, VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Hyper-V, Windows Virtual PC, Xen, Parallels Desktop for Mac, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, VirtualBox and Parallels Workstation.
   
## Types of virtual machine:
   The Two Types of Virtual Machines:
1. Process virtual machines: Execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment. It masks the information of the underlying hardware or operating system 

2. System virtual machines: Support the sharing of a host computer's physical resources between multiple virtual machines.
