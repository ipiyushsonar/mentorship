# what is AWS?
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites
  
   Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that provides customers with a wide array of cloud services. We can define AWS (Amazon Web Services) as a secured cloud services platform that offers compute power, database storage, content delivery and various other functionalities

# Key components of AWS:
## AWS components

#### Storage
#### Databases 
#### Management and security 
#### Networks
#### Analytics
#### Application services
#### Implementation and management

## Storage:
   The simple storage service (S3) from Amazon, Elastic Block Storage (EBS) and CloudFront are three Amazon storage options. Storage in AWS is guaranteed by the pay-per-use model. Amazon S3 is an AWS storage offering, which can store any amount of storage required. It is used for several reasons, such as storing content, backing up, archiving and recovering an accident, as well as storing data.
   
## Databases:
   Along with caching and data storage in the AWS petabyte area, the relational ladder, and the NoSQL database are also included. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that offers large and economical storage. By using EC2 and EBS, users can manage their own databases in AWS. The Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon Redshift are two AWS databases.

   Amazon RDS is used to manage and expand MySQL, Oracle, SQLServer or PostgreSQL in AWS. Based on examples of hours and amount of storage, RDS is used. Redshift is a data storage service through which users can store data in columns instead of rows. Prices are based on case hours, such as $ 0.25 per hour

## Management and security
   The AWS directory service directly connects AWS clouds to local locations. CloudWatch controls the cloud resources for AWS. The AWS AWS CloudTrail API records require AWS user accounts. CloudTrial does it for free.

## Networks
   Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) provides versatile network performance in AWS, which means it provides integrated security and a private cloud. VPC is free with EC2. AWS Direct Connect allows users to connect directly to a cloud that goes through the Internet. The price is per hour.

## Analytics
   AWS provides data analysis services in all areas, such as Hadoop, orchestration and data transmission and real-time storage. EMR (Elastic MapReduce) is an analytical facilitator used by companies, data analysts, researchers and developers to process parts of data. The evaluation is carried out by the hour. Redshift also offers some analytical capabilities.
   
## Application services 
   Amazon SQS (simple queue service) is used to automate the workflow between different services. There is a special queue used to store messages. The service is free up to 1 million messages per month, and then for every million messages, 0.50 USD is charged.

  SWS (Simple Workflow Service) is a task management and coordination service for AWS. 10,000 active tasks, 30,000 working days and 1,000 executions executed for one year are free for users. In addition, users pay approximately $ 0.0001 per workflow.
  
## Implementation and Management
   Elastic Beanstalk uses Java,NET PHP,Node.js, Python and Ruby to implement and measure web applications. Health and registration files can be easily monitored. CloudFormation helps companies and developers gather and provide important AWS resources.
