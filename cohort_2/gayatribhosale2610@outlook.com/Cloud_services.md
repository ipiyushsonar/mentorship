# What are Cloud Services?

The service offered through the internet to the users on-demand rather than by the company’s own servers is called cloud services.
The data is stored in pools or digital servers and is available any time through the internet. Cloud services refer to any 
applications, services or resources. The service is managed by the cloud service provider. The provider provides all the resources
needed for the application and hence the company needs not to worry about resource allocation. Cloud services can dynamically scale 
up based on users’ needs. We can say that the cloud is the delivery of servers, storage, and backups online. Service providers 
charge companies for cloud usage.

The data can be stored online and also backed up, documents can collaborate easily, database processing can be done and technical 
support services can be managed. Also, new applications can be created and managed, data is recovered and streaming audio and video,
data analysis, and prediction are done using cloud services. Users’ activity is tracked easily using cloud and hence it is made secure.

### Types of Cloud Services:

## 1. IaaS

The model that has the infrastructure to be delivered for outsourcing in order to support operations inside the enterprise is called
IaaS. The hardware, software, storage, data centers, servers, and network space is provided in this service. IaaS is rightly called 
Hardware as a Service (HaaS). Platform virtualization is done in IaaS.

IaaS provides cost-cutting on IT infrastructure for mid-level to large scale industries. IaaS is also known as Cloud storage, where
clients store their data on the cloud and can access the data from anyplace.Cloud computing as an evolving technology provides the
best solution in terms of IaaS which provides high scalability and flexibility on operations.

### Benefits of IaaS:

- IaaS provides a “pay per use” scheme, which says the services provided can be used as per needed, and users need to pay only for
the services utilized.

- The services provided by IaaS are quite scalable as they make sure that the resources are available to the users at the desired
time and demand and also ensure that there is no wastage of capacity if left out.

- It saves a lot of time and cost as the cloud service provider is responsible for setting and maintaining the physical hardware.

- The service provided is unaffected and remains constant, even though any hardware failure occurs. -IaaS mostly focuses on business
growth as there any hardly any time is spent on technological and business decisions and how to maintain the infrastructure. IaaS 
takes care of all of these.

## 2. PaaS

- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud-based development model that enables the user to deliver starting from simple applications
needed in day-to-day life to centralized applications required for big organizations.

- The working procedure of PaaS is to provide a smooth working principle in the cloud that includes the entire application development
phase in the cloud.

- With the help of PaaS, we also get additional resources, including database management systems, programming languages, libraries, 
and various software development tools that works on cloud and made our daily life better.

- PaaS has varieties of usefulness and among them, it cuts down the price and headache of installing extra software licenses, core
application, and other platform resources.

- It helps us to organize and maintain useful applications and services whereas third-party providers maintain every other service 
in the cloud.

### Benefits of PaaS:

- Simplified Development: Programmers can focus on development and innovation without worrying about the infrastructure and cloud-
computing tools minimize the time by taking less effort and using smart work using less code as possible to build the apps.

- Flexibility and Portability: Some PaaS service providers give the user lots of choices for using multiple platforms, such as PCs,
laptops and other electronic devices in developing apps quicker and make it portable.

- Efficiency: PaaS has been efficiently managing application development phases in the cloud that includes testing, managing and 
updating apps at regular intervals within the same cloud server and providing a quality and efficient infrastructure.

## 3. SaaS

This represents the largest cloud application services that are growing immensely in today’s digital market. As far as the name goes, 
it provides the necessary software as a service to the user that is managed by some third party services. The software applications
provided can be directly run on any web browser without any need for installing the software. SAAS is basically a web-based model
that produces software on-demand, cloud vendors host application on the server, maintain database and transmit data over the internet 
to the end-user.

### Benefits of SaaS:

- Easy to afford services: SAAS cloud model offers subscription-based services including service cost, maintenance, up-gradation cost,
thus lowering the entire cost that are present on old traditional systems. Thus because of its affordability and wide range of
features, many organizations started using SAAS.

- Fast deployment:For using SAAS services, we need only a web browser and internet connection. SAAS solutions omit the headache of 
installing software on the system. Using a fast, stable internet connection, accessing software will be very fast and components can
be deployed instantly.

- Fast upgrades: SAAS cloud supports on-demand updates and hardware updates when needed. The upgrades are very fast as it eliminates the
downloading of software and patches. The systems are upgraded or downgraded as per user’s choice thus making our life so much easier.

- Flexibility: Users get a chance to access SAAS services from anywhere around the globe. It makes the life of job seekers who used to 
love doing work from home a peace for them. It only requires a strong internet connection to be connected to cloud services.
