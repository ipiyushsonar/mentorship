--------
- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

- **AWS** launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.

- **AWS** offers many different tools and solutions for enterprises and software developers that can be used in data centers in up to 190 countries. Groups such as government agencies, education institutions, nonprofits and private organizations can use AWS services.

## How AWS works.

- AWS is separated into different services; each can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. Users should be able to see configuration options and individual server maps for an AWS service.

- More than 100 services comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio, including those for compute, databases, infrastructure management, application development and security. These services, by category, include:



------
- **Computer
- **Storage databases
- **Data management
- **Migration
- **Hybrid cloud
- **Networking
- **Development tools
- **Management
- **Monitoring
- **Security
- **Governance
- **Big data management
- **Analytics
- **Artificial intelligence (AI)
- **Mobile development
- **Messages and notification

------+

### Availability:

- Amazon Web Services provides services from dozens of data centers spread across availability zones (AZs) in regions across the world. An AZ is a location that contains multiple physical data centers. A region is a collection of AZs in geographic proximity connected by low-latency network links.

- A business will choose one or multiple availability zones for a variety of reasons, such as compliance and proximity to end customers. For example, an AWS customer can spin up virtual machines (VMs) and replicate data in different AZs to achieve a highly reliable infrastructure that is resistant to failures of individual servers or an entire data center.

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a service that provides virtual servers -- called EC2 instances -- for compute capacity. The EC2 service offers dozens of instance types with varying capacities and sizes, tailored to specific workload types and applications, such as memory-intensive and accelerated-computing jobs. AWS also provides an Auto Scaling tool to dynamically scale capacity to maintain instance health and performance.
---------+

### Storage:

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides scalable object storage for data backup, collection and analytics. An IT professional stores data and files as S3 objects -- which can range up to 5 gigabytes (GB) -- inside S3 buckets to keep them organized. A business can save money with S3 through its Infrequent Access storage tier or by using Amazon Glacier for long-term cold storage.

- Amazon Elastic Block Store provides block-level storage volumes for persistent data storage when using EC2 instances. Amazon Elastic File System offers managed cloud-based file storage.

- A business can also migrate data to the cloud via storage transport devices, such as AWS Snowball and Snowmobile, or use AWS Storage Gateway to enable on-premises apps to access cloud data.
---------

## Databases, data management:

- The Amazon Relational Database Service -- which includes options for Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and a proprietary high-performance database called Amazon Aurora -- provides a relational database management system for AWS users. AWS also offers managed NoSQL databases through Amazon DynamoDB.

- An AWS customer can use Amazon ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator as in-memory and real-time data caches for applications. Amazon Redshift offers a data warehouse, which makes it easier for data analysts to perform business intelligence (BI) tasks.
--------

### Migration, hybrid cloud:

- AWS includes various tools and services designed to help users migrate applications, databases, servers and data onto its public cloud. The AWS Migration Hub provides a location to monitor and manage migrations from on premises to the cloud. Once in the cloud, EC2 Systems Manager helps an IT team configure on-premises servers and AWS instances.

- Amazon also has partnerships with several technology vendors that ease hybrid cloud deployments. VMware Cloud on AWS brings software-defined data center technology from VMware to the AWS cloud. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Amazon EC2 is the product of another partnership, extending Red Hat's operating system to the AWS cloud.

-------

### Networking;

- An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives an administrator control over a virtual network to use an isolated section of the AWS cloud. AWS automatically provisions new resources within a VPC for extra protection.

- Admins can balance network traffic with the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service, which includes the Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer. AWS also provides a domain name system called Amazon Route 53 that routes end users to applications.

- An IT professional can establish a dedicated connection from an on-premises data center to the AWS cloud via AWS Direct Connect.
-------

### Developer tools:

- A developer can take advantage of AWS command-line tools and software development kits (SDKs) to deploy and manage applications and services. This includes:

- The AWS Command Line Interface, which is Amazon's proprietary code interface.
A developer can use AWS Tools for Powershell to manage cloud services from Windows environments.
Developers can use AWS Serverless Application Model to simulate an AWS environment to test Lambda functions.
AWS SDKs are available for a variety of platforms and programming languages, including Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, C++, Android and iOS.

- Amazon API Gateway enables a development team to create, manage and monitor custom application program interfaces (APIs) that let applications access data or functionality from back-end services. API Gateway manages thousands of concurrent API calls at once.  

- AWS also provides a packaged media transcoding service -- Amazon Elastic Transcoder -- and a service that visualizes workflows for microservices-based applications -- AWS Step Functions.

## features and benefits of Amazon Web Services (EC2):


#### Functionality:

- Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage your networkâ€™s access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as you desire.
--------+

#### To use Amazon EC2, you simply:

- Select a pre-configured, templated Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to get up and running immediately. Or create an AMI containing your applications, libraries, data, and associated configuration settings.

- Configure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.

- Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.

- Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.


- Pay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.
---------

## Features

- Amazon EC2 provides a number of powerful features for building scalable, failure resilient, enterprise class applications.

 ### Bare Metal instances
Amazon EC2 bare metal instances provide your applications with direct access to the processor and memory of the underlying server. These instances are ideal for workloads that require access to hardware feature sets (such as IntelÂ® VT-x), or for applications that need to run in non-virtualized environments for licensing or support requirements. Bare metal instances are built on the Nitro system, a collection of AWS-built hardware offload and hardware protection components that come together to securely provide high performance networking and storage resources to EC2 instances. Bare metal instances are EC2 instances and thus offer the same robust security, reliability, capacity elasticity, and support for different operating systems and software packages as other virtual EC2 instances. You can also use bare metal instances with AWS services such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and more.
Optimize Compute Performance and Cost with Amazon EC2 Fleet
With a single API call, Amazon EC2 Fleet lets you provision compute capacity across EC2 instance types, Availability Zones, and purchase models to help optimize scale, performance and cost. You can specify how much On-Demand and Spot capacity to launch via EC2 Fleet. You can also define which instance types you prefer and whether to scale capacity based on cores, instances or memory. Read FAQs and AWS blog to learn more. Now you can access EC2 Fleet capabilities via Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to provision and automatically scale compute capacity across EC2 instance types, Availability Zones, and purchase options in a single Auto Scaling Group. Learn more>>
Pause and Resume Your Instances
You can hibernate your Amazon EC2 instances backed by Amazon EBS, and resume them from this state at a later time. Applications that take a while to bootstrap and persist state into memory (RAM) can benefit from this feature. Hibernation gives you all the benefits of Stop and Start, and additionally, data from memory (RAM) is also persisted between sessions. You will not be charged for instance usage while your instance is hibernated. Storage is charged at standard EBS rates. For more information about hibernation, and supported instance types and operating systems, visit the FAQs.

****A distributed denial of service (DDoS)**** attack is an attack in which multiple compromised systems attempt to flood a target, such as a network or web application, with traffic. A DDoS attack can prevent legitimate users from accessing a service and can cause the system to crash due to the overwhelming traffic volume.

AWS provides two levels of protection against DDoS attacks: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.



## AWS Shield Standard


All AWS customers benef
it from the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your website or applications. While AWS Shield Standard helps protect all AWS customers, you get particular benefit if you are using Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53. These services receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks.

### AWS Shield Advanced

For higher levels of protection against attacks, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. When you subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced and add specific resources to be protected, AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack protection for web applications running on the resources.

------------
- You can add protection for any of the following resources:

- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Elastic IP addresses

- Amazon CloudFront distributions

- Amazon Route 53 hosted zones

- AWS Global Accelerator accelerators


---------

For example, if you use Shield Advanced to protect an Elastic IP address, Shield Advanced automatically deploys your network ACLs to the border of the AWS network during an attack. When your network ACLs are at the border of the network, Shield Advanced can provide protection against larger DDoS events. Typically, network ACLs are applied near your Amazon EC2 instances within your Amazon VPC. The network ACL can mitigate attacks only as large as your Amazon VPC and instance can handle. If the network interface attached to your Amazon EC2 instance can process up to 10 Gbps, volumes over 10 Gbps slow down and possibly block traffic to that instance. During an attack, Shield Advanced promotes your network ACL to the AWS border, which can process multiple terabytes of traffic. Your network ACL is able to provide protection for your resource well beyond your network's typical capacity. For more information about network ACLs, see Network ACLs.

The point at which Shield Advanced detects attacks and places mitigations depends on the architecture you use for your web applications. It varies based on characteristics like the type of instance you use, your instance size, and whether you use enhanced networking.

As an AWS Shield Advanced customer, you can contact a 24x7 DDoS response team (DRT) for assistance during a DDoS attack. You also have exclusive access to advanced, real-time metrics and reports for extensive visibility into attacks on your AWS resources. With the assistance of the DRT, AWS Shield Advanced includes intelligent DDoS attack detection and mitigation for not only for ****network layer (layer 3) and transport layer (layer 4) attacks, but also for application layer (layer 7) attacks.****



-------
AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced.

All AWS customers benefit from the automatic protections of AWS Shield Standard, at no additional charge. AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications. When you use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53, you receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) attacks.

For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 resources, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. In addition to the network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall. AWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53 charges.

AWS Shield Advanced is available globally on all Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 edge locations. You can protect your web applications hosted anywhere in the world by deploying Amazon CloudFront in front of your application. Your origin servers can be Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), or a custom server outside of AWS. You can also enable AWS Shield Advanced directly on an Elastic IP or Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in the following AWS Regions - Northern Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Northern California, Montreal, SÃ£o Paulo, Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, and Mumbai.

----

## Benefit
sSeamless integration and deployment
Your AWS resources automatically have AWS Shield Standard and are protected from common, most frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks. You can achieve a higher level of defense by simply enabling AWS Shield Advanced protection for Elastic IP, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, or Amazon Route 53 resources you want to protect using the management console or APIs. No routing changes are required for enabling these protections.


-----
## Customizable protection
With AWS Shield Advanced, you have the flexibility to choose the resources to protect for infrastructure (Layer 3 and 4) protection. You can write customized rules with AWS WAF to mitigate sophisticated application layer attacks. These customizable rules can be deployed instantly, allowing you to quickly mitigate attacks. You can set up rules proactively to automatically block bad traffic, or respond to incidents as they occur. You also have 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT), who can write rules on your behalf to mitigate application layer DDoS attacks#
