### Cost Saving

 Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. 

### Example:

>### No new equipment is necessary

 You do not have to pay for new devices to accommodate your cloud computing services. The programs are designed to be accessed from many different devices that run various operating systems, such as Mac and Windows. 

>### Don't need specialized tech teams

 Think about the cost of a specialized tech team. Wouldn't it be easier to hand over the tedious operations to a professional team, without the professional team price? When you hire your own tech team, you have to pay training, salaries, and downtime. Cloud computing services provide the same service for less. 

### Security

 In the ever-increasing era of data breaches, a top cloud computing security solution has security protocols in place to protect sensitive information and transactions. This prevents a third party from eavesdropping or tampering with data being transmitted. 

### Example:

>### Data Encryption -

 Robust data encryptionsencryptions within cloud-based security systems have substantially reduced the possibilities of data breaches, these solutions offer a layer approach that consists of security intelligence, key management, and secure access controls. 

>### Secure Storage - 

 Traditional storage solutions don't provide any protection against possible disasters that have the potential to erase required data from devices. Cloud computing allows the users to store their data safely thereby negating any mishaps that may affect the equipment. 

### Flexibility

 Cloud computing allows your employees to be more flexible -- both in and out of the workplace. Employees can access files using web-enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops and notebooks. The ability to simultaneously share documents and other files over the internet can also help support borh internal and external collaboration. Many employers are now implementing ""bring your own device (BYOD)" policies. In this way, cloud computing enables the use of mobile technology. 

### Mobility

 Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers. 

### Increased Collaboration

 We live in a global world, usually, companies have offices in different cities, countries, continents and here they face to collaboration problem. How to deliver information fast and safe at any time? With the cloud, it is not a problem anymore. Your teams can access, edit and shared documents, from anywhere, they're able to do more together and do it better. Cloud-based workflow and file sharing apps help them make updates in real time and gives them full visibility of their collaborations. Also, it improves employees worklife, they can work from home and access all needed information. 

### Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing

 Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform. Cloud disaster recovery (cloud DR) is a combination of strategies and services intended to back up data, applications and other resources to public cloud or dedicated service providers. When disaster occurs, the affected data, applications and other resources can be restored to the local data center or a cloud provider and resume normal operation for the enterprise. 

### Automatic Software Updates

 Cloud providers usually provide a cloud service model known as Software as a Service (SaaS). One of the benefits of this model is that it ensures that software vendors take care of regular software and security updates on behalf of the users. Thus, users don't have to worry about routine software maintenance practices which enables them to concentrate more on their core businesses. 

### Competitive Edge

 Competitive advantage from cloud computing are realized in unexpected areas including advanced customer relationships driven by big data analytics, precise business decision making from cloud decision support systems, and enhanced business collaborations. The improvements in competitive advantage from cloud computing collaboration systems originate from rapid exchange of decision capable information to those who consume decision information. The sharing of decision information in a cloud platform from any information format and type, enables a higher level of business collaboration and value through decision accuracy, speed, and analysis. 

### Sustainability

 Cloud services make a positive contribution to sustainability. The cloud encourages important clean-tech applications like smart grids and it also encourages consumers to use virtual services such as video streaming to replace resource-heavy physical products. The cloud also draws resources to where they are usef mist efficiently and its jobs tend to be cleaner and safer than those of more traditional industries. 

### Benefits of Sustainability

 - Reduces energy use

 - Decrease greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions

 - Dematerialization

 - Data center efficiency
