# What is Cloud Computing? 

 - If you're unsure about what Cloud Computing is, you are probably among the 95% of people that are already using cloud services, like online banking and social networks, but don't realise it.

 - The "cloud" is a set of different types of hardware and software that work collectively to deliver many aspects of computing to the end-user as an online service. 

 - Cloud Computing is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network (typically the Internet). With cloud computing, users can access files and use applications from any device that can access the Internet.

 - An example of a Cloud Computing provider is Google's and Gmail. Gmail users can access files and applications hosted by Google via the internet from any device. 

# How is computing from the Cloud different from computing from my PC's hard drive? 

 - Unlike traditional computing where data is stored on your PC's local hard drive, the data in the cloud is stored on many physical and/or virtual servers that are hosted by a third-party service provider. An example of a cloud computing file storage provider is Dropbox. Dropbox files can be accessed from any device via the Internet. 

# What are public and private Clouds? 

 - A Public Cloud is based on the standard cloud computing framework which consists of files, applications, storage and services available to the public via the internet. Gmail is an example of a Public Cloud. 

 - A Private Cloud is comprised of files, applications, storage and services that are implemented and protected within a corporate firewall, under the control of a corporate IT department. An example of Private Cloud would be a company that uses Microsoft Exchange because Microsoft Exchange can only be accessed by an authorized user through a secure VPN connection. 

# What are some common Cloud services and companies? 

 - Some common services that are hosted in the cloud are hosted desktop, provided by companies like AT&T; hosted email like Gmail, provided by companies like Google; cloud storage, provided by companies like Dropbox; and streaming music, provided by companies like Spotify. These services, applications and files are stored in the cloud and can be accessed by users via any device. 
 
 - There are a wide range of companies and industry verticals that use cloud computing such as Amazon and Google. Small, medium, and large size public and private companies alike use cloud computing to reduce technology acquisition costs. 

# Do I need Cloud computing? 

 - The Cloud Computing market continues to grow year after year because companies are becoming more aware of the cost saving benefits of adopting the cloud. 

 - With Hardware services, companies are able to use the cloud service provider and are made available over a network saving costly deployment and maintenance costs. 

# Are my files safe in the Cloud? 

 - While no storage solution is 100% safe, cloud storage providers can offer a safer and more accessible place for companies to store data than traditional computing methods. 

 - Depending on the service contract, duplicate copies of the companies' data can be stored on the servers located in different geographies and protected by backup power supplies in the case of disaster. 

 - Today, many companies are moving to Hybrid Cloud Computing model. With this model, companies are given the flexibility of storing sensitive data securely in a private cloud whlie storing public data in a public cloud. Both infrastructures are kept as seperate, unique entities. 

# What the Cloud is NOT? 

 - The cloud is not a fluffy white mass made up of tiny water droplets floating in cyber space. The cloud is not impacted by weather changes like barometric pressure. 

 - The cloud is not a place in a single location. In fact, the cloud can be anywhere. The cloud can be in your companies data center or hosted at a third-party data center. 

 - The growth of the cloud is not being driven by "big business." The growth of the cloud is being driven by consumers buying cloud ready devices that can connect to cloud computing services at work, at home, and on-the-go. 

 - The cloud is not "a fad." There are currently 1.2 billion people using Facebook worldwide. That number represents 11% of the world's population.

# Applications of Cloud Computing:

### • Online File Storage:-
     
  MediaFire, megaupload, hotfile, 4Shared, rapidshare, yourfilehost are such examples which are used to host files including documents, images, presentation, videos, etc. The interface is easy to use, and users can upload and download files from these sites. 

### • Photo Editing Software:-

  Picnik, Pixlr, etc are popular free online photo editing software. This online software has features such as cropping of the image, resizing, rotation based on degrees, special effects, addition and editing features are also included in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) format. 

### • E-commerce Software:- 

  Cloud based e-application allows users and e-business to respond quickly to market opportunities and challenges the modern e-commerce is facing. It became for business tycoons to focus on the usage of cloud computing without considering the time and effort involved in implementing a reliable solution. 

### • Miscellaneous Application:- 

  One of the first utilization of free SaaS applications is to check for the status of packages and items. Applications such as UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, etc provides free tracking of packages online. Another application name - XE provides services online from foreign exchange tools. 

### • Presentation Software:- 

  Sliderocket is an online free application to create a presentation. It allows importing of Microsoft's PowerPoint presentations. Since it is web based cloud application, the presentations can be accessed from anywhere within the globe. 

### • Word Processing Application:-

  Whiteboard is another online word processing and document editing application. It has a unique feature that multiple users can access the same document using this application, edit that document and save the document after editing, but the document will have different versions. But it doesn't allow importing the word files. 

# Introduction to Github

  Github is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. 

# What is Version Control? 

 - Version Control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project's code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress... 

 - At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn't be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the "official" source code. 

 - Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. 

 - With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project. 

 - Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code to make it official. 

 - All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be. 

# What is Git? 

 - Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

 - Specifically, Git is distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer's computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. 
 
# Fork in Git
 
 - A fork is a copy of repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 

# Star in Git

 - Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your stars page. 

 - Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of Github's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. 

# Watch in Git

  By enabling watch in git, notifications will be received by the owner for all the ongoing activities. 

# Pull request in Git

  A pull request is basically asking the person in charge of the branch to include your code. And it also helps that person see exactly what you've changed in the code. Once some changes made, you could submit that code back to a branch by making a pull request. 

# Markdown Language

   Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lusts are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
   Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

   Markdown is used in following places:

 - Git

 - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests

 - Files with the .md or.markdown extension

   Disaster Recovery
 
   CapEx and OpEx 

# Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing

 - Data is the most valuable asset. Its loss can result in massive damage to your business, even the loss of reputation. 

 - It is hard to predict when a disaster will occur and how serious its impact will be. 

 - Cloud disaster recovery stores the system data on a remote cloud-based platform. 

 - With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary recovery site. 

 - You can always have a backup copy, even if one of the cloud data centers fails. 

 - State-of-the-art network infrastructure of the cloud provider ensures that there are'nt any issues or errors. 

# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 

- Understanding CapEx:

1. Capital Expenditures are equipments or services that are bought to improve or support a company's performance in the future. For example: A production house buys camera's, photostudios, shooting equipments. This becomes the capital expenditure spent by the production house. 

2. The expenses made should profit the company in the future. 

3. The expenses become fixed assets and the value depreciates with time. 

4. There's only little guarantee that the investment activities brings success to the company in its useful life period. 

5. Capital Expenditures (CapEx) are a company's major, longterm investments.

- Understanding OpEx:

1. Operating expenses are the costs of a company incurs for running day-to-day operations. 

2. These are examples of operating expenses: rent and utilities. 

3. The goal of any company is to maximize profits in near future as compare to CapEx. 

4. If the company is unsure of it's future, it won't risk a hefty amount of debt upon itself and the company will choose to rent a piece of equipment instead of purchasing. 

# Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus Operational expenditure (OpEx) 

### The key difference between both are:

 - Funds that fall under capital expenditures are for major purchases that will be used im the future. The life of these purchases extends beyond the current accounting period in which they were purchased. Because these costs can be recovered only over time through depreciation, companies usually prepare a capital expense budget apart from operational expenditure. 

 - Operating expenses represent the day-to-day expenses necessary to run a business. Because these are short-term costs that are used up in the same accounting period in which they were purchased, it makes sense for them to habe a separate budget. 

 - CapEx cannot be fully deducted in the period when they were incurred. Tangible assets are depreciated and intangible assets are amortized over time. On the other hand, operating expenses are fully deducted in the accounting period during which they were incurred. 

 - Money spent on inventory falls under capital expenditure. While the money spent turning inventory into throughout is operational expenditure. 

 - Capital expenditure incurred for buying the income producing property. Operational expenditure costs associated with the operation and maintenance of an income producing property. 

># Cloud Storage:

 - Cloud services have become the most suitable option for storing data online digitally. 

 - In the earlier times, most of the companies used to depend on their private servers fir storing their growing collection of data and online files; but today storing data online on cloud servers is the next big thing as it allows unlimited storage. 

 - The best thing about storing all the data in the cloud is that it ensures affordability and the data can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world. 

# Benefits of online data storage in the cloud:

### Usability and Accessibility

 - Users can easily upload the files in the cloud storage. 

 - It is easy to save all the files and data in the cloud, no technical knowledge is required for this purpose. 

 - The stored files can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks and an internet connection. 

### Disaster Recovery

 - It is recommended for every business to have a backup plan in case of any emergency. 

 - After all, losing important business data can cause huge losses to any business. 

 - Cloud storage is the perfect backup plan for businesses. It creates a backup of the files stored. 

 - These files are stored at a remote location and they can be retrieved and accessed at any time. 

### Security

 - Business owners can be sure that once the data is stored in the cloud, it is safe. 

 - The best thing about using cloud storage is that server data is distributed across many servers and the data stored in the cloud is protected against any type of the hardware failure. 

 - Cloud servers also provide automated backups in order to make sure that your data is safe. 

### Cost Saving

 - Businesses and organizations can reduce annual operating costs by utilizing cloud storage. 

 - Affordability can be ensured if data is stored online in the cloud. 

 - Users can ensure additional cost saving because internal power and resources are not required separately for storing the data. 

### Easy Sharing

 - Data stored in cloud storage can be easily shared with clients and colleagues in an easy and secure way. 

### Automation

 - With cloud storage technology, the tedious task of data backups is simplified through automation. 

 - You simply have to select what you want to backup and when you want to backup and your cloud environment will take care of the rest. 

### Collaboration

 - A cloud environment enables multiple people to access, edit and colloborate on a single file or document. 

 - People can access the cloud environment from anywhere in the world and colloborate in real-time. 

### Scalable Service

 - Cloud hosting makes sure that you only pay for the resources that you actually use. 

 - You can scale your cloud hosting environment whenever required and you can also defines the attributes of scaling the cloud. 

 - This ensures more flexibility and a large storage space. 

### Convenience

 - Even if you store data on transportable devices like external hard drives or flash drives, some kind of manual intervention and physical handling is required. 

 - The data that is stored in a cloud is backed up online and it can be accessed from anywhere. 

#### Hence, online cloud storage and backup is beneficial for all types of businesses. 

># Scaling in Cloud Computing:

1. Scaling is the ability of a company or organization to handle increasing or decreasing demands in a capable manner, so that the customers or the company itself don't face any issue because of the fluctuating demands. 

2. Thus, scalability is a planned level of capacity that can grow or shrink as needed. 

3. There are three ways to scale in cloud. 

### 1.Vertical Scaling (Up Scaling) :

 - With cloud computing, you can add or subtract resources like storage or processing power. 

 - You can take a example of a Multi-level parking lot. 

 - There's almost countless space, that vehicles can occupy anytime. Mostly there's alot of space available as the place is almost never completely occupied, as long as the capacity is not exceeded. 

 - Similarly changes can be made in your Vm as per the need. 

 - This is Vertical Scaling. 

### 2.Horizontal Scaling (Out Scaling):

 - Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling. 

 - This method take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together. 

 - You can also handle traffic efficiently and execute complex workloads. 

### 3.Diagonal Scaling (Mixed Scaling):

 - When we combine horizontal and vertical scaling together, we get diagonal scaling. 

 - It is the most efficient infrastructure scaling. 

 - It is simply increasing the resources of our existing servers until it reaches its limit. 

 - Then we can add more servers to our infrastructure and continue with our process. 

## Takeaway:

 - We experience great amount of flexibility that saves both money and time for a business. 

 - Cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go model. 

 - This on-demand nature is what makes the cloud so easy and interesting.

 1. What is Cloud Deployment Model? 

 2. What are the different types of Cloud deployment models? 

# 1. What is Cloud deployment model? 

 - A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access. It is a configuration of environment parameters such as the accessibility and proprietorship of the deployment infrastructure and storage size. It means that deployment types vary depending on who controls the infrastructure and where it resides. 

# 2. What are the different types of Cloud deployment models? 

 - Depending upon the infrastructure, storage and accessibility, there are four different types of cloud deployment models. They are:

## 1. Public Cloud

 - As the name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers. The server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage them and administer pool resources, which is why there is no need need for user companies to buy and maintain their hardware. The provider companies offer resources as a service both free of charge or on a pay-per-use basis via internet connection. Users can scale resources as per their need. 

### Advantages:

 • Hassle-free infrastructure management

 • High scalability

 • Reduced costs

 • 24/7 uptime

### Disadvantages:

 • Compromised reliability. 

 • Data security and privacy give rise to concern. 

 • The lack of a bespoke service. 

## 2. Private Cloud

 - Only one organization uses this deployment model to run its workloads, and the server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the user company. There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar. A private model is especially suitable for companies that seek to safeguard their mission-critical operations or for businesses with changing requirements. 

### Advantages:

 • Bespoke and flexible development

 • High security, privacy and reliability

 • High scalability

### Disadvantages:

 • Costly

 • Requires considerable expenses on hardware, software and staff training. 

## 3. Community Cloud

 - In this case of community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources. If the organizations have uniform security, privacy and performance requirements, this multi-tenant data center architecture helps companies achieve their business-specific objectives. It is particularly suited for organizations that work on joint projects. In that case, a centralized cloud facilities project development, management and implementation. Also, the costs are shared across all users. 

### Advantages:

 • Cost reduction

 • Improved security, privacy and reliability

 • Ease of data sharing and collaboration

### Disadvantages:

 • High cost if compared to a public deployment model

 • Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity

## 4. Hybrid Cloud
 
 - A hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above mentioned development models - public, private and community ones. It allows companies to mix and match the facets of all three types that best suit their requirements. 

### Advantages:

 • Improved security and privacy

 • Enhanced scalability and flexibility

 • Reasonable price

### Disadvantages:

 • The hybrid deployment model only makes sense if companies can split their data into mission-critical and non-sensitive.

 1. Virtual Machine 

 2. How virtual machine works? 

 3. Importance of virtual machine

 4. Advantages of virtual machine

 5. Disadvantages of virtual machine

# 1. Virtual Machine:

  A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off or on premises). Software called a hypervisor seperates the machine's resources from the hardware and the provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM. The physical machines, equipped with a hypervisor such as Kernel-Based Virtual Machine(KVM), is called the host machine, host computer, host operating system, or simply host. The many VMs that use its resources are guest machines, guest computers, guest operating systems, or simply guests. The hypervisor treats compute resources like CPU, memory, and storage as a pool of resources that can easily be relocated between existing guests or to new virtual machines. 

  VMs are isolated from the rest of the system, and multiple VMs can exist on a single piece of hardware, like a server. They can be moved between host servers depending on demand or to use resources more efficiently. VMs allow multiple different operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer like a Linux® distro on a MacOS laptop. Each operating system runs in the same way an operating system or application normally would on the host hardware, so the end user experience emulated within the VM is nearly identical to a real-time operating system experience running on a physical machine. 

# 2. How Virtual Machines works? 

  Virtualization Technology allows you to share a system with many virtual environments. The hypervisor manages the hardware and separates the physical resources from the virtual environments. Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the VMs. When the VM is running and user or program issues and instruction that requires additional resources from the physical environment, the hypervisor schedules the request to the physical system's resources so that virtual machine's operating system and applications can access the shared pool of the physical resources. 

  Server consolidation is a top reason to use VMs. Most operating system and application deployments only use a small amount of the physical resources available when deployed to bare metal. By virtualizing your servers, you can place many virtual onto each physical server to improve hardware utilization. This keeps you from needing to purchase additional physical resources, like hard drives, hard disks, as well as reducing the need for power, space, and cooling in the datacenter. VMs provide additional disaster recovery options by enabling failover and redundancy that could previously only be achieved through additional hardware. 

  A VM provides an environment that is isolated from the rest of a system, so whatever is running inside a VM won't interfere with anything else running on the host hardware. Because VMs are isolated, they are a good option for testing new applications or setting up a production environment. You can also run a single purpose VM to support a specific process. 

# 3. Importance of Virtual Machine:

  Virtual Machine or VMs have become integral parts of businessoriented computing. A virtual machine acts as an emulator of a computer, executing programs like one. In summary, it is a piece of software that allows you to run operating systems within. It can give a company adaptability, in that any networking configurations or installed applications will be set up separately from the host computer, but rather will dwell in the software. While there are many progressive advantages to implementing virtual machines, there are also some disadvantages. 

# 4. Advantages of Virtual Machine:

 - Can use multiple operating system environments on the same computer. 

 - Virtual machine can provide an instruction set architecture, or ISA, structure different than the actual computer. The ISA serves as the interface between software and hardware. 

 - When yoi create your virtual machine, you create a virtual hard disk. So, everything on that machine can crash, but if it does, it won't affect the host machine. 

 - There are security benefits to running virtual machines. For example, if you need to run an application of questionable security, you can run it in a guest operating system. So if the application causes damage then it will be only temporary after the guest is shut down. 
 
 - Virtual machines also allow for better security forensics by monitoring guest operating systems for deficiencies and allowing the user to quarantine it for analysis. 

# 5. Disadvantages of Virtual Machine:

 - Virtual machines are less efficient than real machines because they access the hardware indirectly. Running software on top of the host operating system means that it will have to request access to the hardware from the host. That will slow the usability. 

 - When several virtual machines are running on the same host, performancay be hindered if the computer is running on lack sufficient power. 

 - A virtual machine can be infected with the weaknesses of the host machine. As an example, process isolation is a feature usually employed by operating systems. However there are bugs that violate it. 

 - A regular computer devoid of virtual machines would then only be affected. But, a computer with a number of virtual machines would then infect each of those "machines" as well.

 1. What is cloud service? 

 2. What are the different types of cloud services? 

# 1. What is cloud service? 

 - Cloud service is any service made available to users on demand through the internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider. They are provided on demand and you have to pay only for the services you require. Thus, cloud services are dynamic and can be scale as per the requirement of users. As the cloud service provider supplies all necessary hardware and software components, so the company didn't need to take care of it, and appoint any staff to manage it. 

 - Example of cloud services include:-

   • Data storage

   • Backup solutions

   • Email services

   • Hosting

   • Database handling and processing
 
   • Technical support

# 2. What are the different types of cloud services? 

 - Cloud computing services falls under three broad categories they are:-

1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 

2. Platform as a service (PaaS) 

3. Software as a service (SaaS) 

   Let's know more about them, 

## 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):

 - IaaS provides the basic building block for cloud IT. It gives access to networking, computer (virtual or dedicated) and data storage space. It is a pay-as-you-go service. 

### IaaS is commonly usef in the following scenarios:
   
  Migrating workload workloads. Typically, IaaS facilities are managed in a similar way as on-premises infrastructure and provide an easy migration path for moving existing applications to the cloud. 
   
  Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes scaling development and testing environments, fast and economical. 
   
  Storage, backup, and recovery. Organizations avoid the capital outlay and complexity of storage management, which typically which require skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS is useful for managing unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. IaaS can also simplify the planning and management of backup and recovery systems.# 2. Platform as a service (PaaS):

## 2. Platform as a service (PaaS):

 - PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and software systems). It allows to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don't need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy systems involved. It is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without thinking about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development. 

### PaaS is commonly used in the following scenarios:

  Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Just like Microsoft Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.

  Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data. They can find insights and patterns, and predict outcomes to improve business decisions such as forecasting, product design, and investment returns.

## 3. Software as a service (SaaS):

 - SaaS supplies you a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. Mostly people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web- based email). With a SaaS offering, you don't have to care about the service is maintenance or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You cab just focus on the usage of particular software. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. 

 - One other part of cloud service is serverless computing- like PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continuously managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The setup, capacity planning and server management for you is done by the service provider. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, you can use a specific function only when a specific function or trigger occurs using different allocated resources. 

### Management responsibilities

 One thing to understand is that these categories are layers on top of each other. For example, PaaS adds a layer on top of IaaS by providing a level of abstraction. The abstraction has the benefit of hiding the details that you may not care about, so that you can get to coding quicker. However, one aspect of the abstraction is that you have less control over the underlying hardware. The following illustration shows a list of resources that you manage and that your service provider manages in each cloud service category.

 - IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications. 

 - PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store. 

 - SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.

 1. What is Latency in Cloud Computing? 
 
 2. What is Load Balancing in Cloud Computing? 

## 1. What is Latency in Cloud Computing? 

 - Cloud service latency is the delay of time between a client request and a cloud service provider's response. 

 - Let's take a example:

   • Imagine you went to a restaurant and order something. 

   • There's a time delay in preparing the dish, and serving it to your table. 
 
   • This is Latency. 
 
   • Also, buffering delays of online video streaming is Latency. 

 - We as a client, request some service or something to the cloud provider and in return the provider fulfills our request. 

 - Latency greatly affects how usable and enjoyable devices and communication requests are. 

 - We as a customer, certainly wish our client requests get solved within no time. 

 - It is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another in networking. 

## 2. What is Load Balancing in Cloud Computing? 

 - Cloud load balancing is defined as the method of splitting workloads and computing properties in a cloud computing. 

 - It helps companies to manage workload demands or application demands by distributing resources among numerous computers, networks or servers. 

 - The traffic on the internet grows rapidly, hence the workload on the server grows fast which leads to the overloading of servers in various organizations. 

 - There are two methods to overcome the problem of overloading on the servers. 

 - First is a single-server solution in which the server is upgraded to a higher performance server. 

 - But the new server may also be overloaded soon, demanding another upgrade. 

 - Also the upgrading process is arduous and expensive. 

 - Second is a multiple-server solution in which a scalable service system on a cluster of servers is built. 

 - It is more cost effective as well as more scalable to build a server cluster system for network services. 

## Importance of Load Balancing

### 1. Better Performance:

 - Load balancing techniques are less expensive and easy to implement as compared to its other options available. 

 - Organizations can work on their client's applications much more faster and deliver better performance at relatively lower costs. 

### 2. Maintain Website Traffic:

 - Cloud Balancing provides scalability to control website traffic. 

 - With the help of effective load balancers, you can easily manage high-end user traffic with the servers and network devices. 

 - Cloud Balancing plays a crucial role for e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart, who are dealing with millions of visitors every single second. 

 - Load Balancers help them to distribute and manage workloads at the time of promotional and sale offers. 

### 3. Handle Sudden Traffic Burst:

 - Load Balancers have this ability to handle any sudden traffic received at a particular time. 

 - For example, a college or university website can shut down during result declaration due to too many requests arrivals at the same time. 

 - If they are using load balancers they do not gave to worry about any amount of traffic burst. 

 - No matter how big is the traffic, load balancers equally divide entire website load into different servers for maximum results in a minimum response time. 

### 4. Flexibility:

 - The main objective of using a load balancer is to protect the website from a sudden shutdown. 

 - When the workload is distributed among a number of servers, even if one of them fails, the load could be shifted to another one. 

 - This shows scalability, flexibility and thw handling ability of traffic. 

>## Uptime and Downtime:

 1. A growing challenge for applications is obtaining optimal availability at all time. 

 2. Uptime is a computer industry term for the time during which a computer is operational. 

 3. Downtime is the time when it isn't operational. 

### More about Uptime:

 - Uptime is very important for businesses who rely heavily on their websites, or whose customers rely on them. 

 - If customers start thinking your business's website is unreliable, they may stop coming back, resulting in loss of sales. 

 - If search engines like Google start to fail often, people might think that their website is unreliable, they will stop visiting as well, resulting in poor search engine results. 

 - Uptime is measured in terms of a percentile. 

 - For example, one standard for uptime that is a goal of a computer that is operational 99.999 percent of the time. 

 - Many cloud hosting companies create aggressive SLAs around their uptime guarantee, whether it's a 99%, 99.9%, or 100% uptime guarantee. 

 - Having a hosting provider that guarantees uptime is much better than one that doesn't. 

 - Keep in mind - uptime guarantees do not include scheduled outages or maintenance. 

### More about Downtime:

 - Downtime refers to periods of time during which a computer system, server or network is shut off or unavailable for use. 

 - Systems go through periods of downtime for a number of reasons, including power or hardware failure, system crashes, hacker attacks, system reboots, operating system and/or software updates, lack of network connectivity and more. 

 - While some downtime events are planned as part of maintenance schedules "planned downtime",in many cases periods of downtime result from unplanned or unexpected events like network outages and hardware failure. 

 - Downtime might result in huge losses for big businesses. 

>## Summary

    Every business has different needs and requirements. Cloud Computing is flexible and cost-efficient, which can be beneficial to every business, whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise.

## Client-Server Computing

   In client server computing, the clients requests a resource and the server provides that resource.

 - A server may serve multiple clients at the same time while a client is in contact with only one server.

 - Both the client and server usually communicate via a computer network but sometimes they may reside in the same system.

   A client does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web. 

### Characteristics of Client-Server Computing
 
    The salient points for client server computing are as follows:

 - The client server computing works with a system of request and response. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the desired information.

 - The client and server should follow a common communication protocol so they can easily interact with each other. All the communication protocols are available at the application layer.

 - A server can only accommodate a limited number of client requests at a time. So it uses a system based to priority to respond to the requests.
   Denial of Service attacks hindera servers ability to respond to authentic client requests by inundating it with false requests.

 - An example of a client server computing system is a web server. It returns the web pages to the clients that requested them.

### Difference between Client-Server Computing and Peer to Peer Computing

    The major differences between client server computing and peer to peer computing are as follows:

 - In client server computing, a server is a central node that services many client nodes. 
 
 - On the other hand, in a peer to peer system, the nodes collectively use their resources and communicate with each other.

 - In client server computing the server is the one that communicates with the other nodes. 

 - In peer to peer to computing, all the nodes are equal and share data with each other directly.
 
 - Client Server computing is believed to be a subcategory of the peer to peer computing.

### Advantages of Client Server Computing

    The different advantages of client server computing are:

 - All the required data is concentrated in a single place i.e. the server. 

 - So it is easy to protect the data and provide authorisation and authentication.

 - The server need not be located physically close to the clients. 
   Yet the data can be accessed efficiently.

 - It is easy to replace, upgrade or relocate the nodes in the client server model because all the nodes are independent and request data only from the server.

 - All the nodes i.e clients and server may not be build on similar platforms yet they can easily facilitate the transfer of data.

### Disadvantages of Client Server Computing

    The different disadvantages of client server computing are:

 - If all the clients simultaneously request data from the server, it may get overloaded. 
 
 - This may lead to congestion in the network or we call it as Latency. 

 - If the server fails for any reason, then none of the requests of the clients can be fulfilled. This leads of failure of the client server network.
   The cost of setting and maintaining a client server model are quite high.

>## What are Containers? 

 - Containers provide a consistent isolated execution environment for applications. 

 - They are similar to VM's but they don't require a guest OS. 

 - It is isolated test environment where all the execution of the application is done. 

 - The result is the application runs quickly and reliably. 

 - Ex. Docker is a leading platform for **containers** as it is efficient, lightweight approach to application deployment

 - It allows different components of the application to be deployed independently into different containers. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/82722093-2032db80-9ce1-11ea-9701-569697db6d8f.png) 

### Benefits of Containers:

 - A container may be only tens of megabytes in size, whereas a virtual machine with its own entire operating system may be several gigabytes in size. 

 - Because of this, a single server can host far more containers than virtual machines. 

 - It saves us time as bootloading is faster. 

 - Rather than run an entire complex application inside a single container, the application can be split into modules. 

 - This makes it easier for the developers to manage the applications. 

>## Serverless Computing

 - Serverless computing means the servers executes code that developers write using only the exact amount of compute resources needed to complete the task, no more, no less. 

 - You can execute your code without worrying about the infrastructure or management of the servers. That's serverless. 

## Pros of Serverless Computing

 - It allows you to pay the service providers to manage servers, databases and even application logic that you might otherwise manage yourself. 

 - Serverless programs have architectures that are inherently scalable. 

 - Serverless computing helps teams increase their productivity and bring products to market faster and it allows organizations to better optimiseb resources and stay focused on innovation. 

## Note:-

 - Amazon Web Services is largely credited with starting the serverless market hype in 2014 when the company introduced Lambda, its serverless computing product. 

 - Note that although called serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them. 

 - Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. 

 - With serverless applications the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. In understanding the definition of serverless computing, it is important to note that servers are still running the code. The serverless name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. This approach enables developers to increase their focus on the business logic and deliver more value to the core of the business. 

## Top benefits of Serverless Computing

**1. No infrastructure management**:

Using fully managed services enables developers to avoid administrative tasks and focus on core business logic. With a serverless platform, you simply deploy your code and it runs with high availability. 

**2. Dynamic scalability**:

With serverless computing, the infrastructure dynamically scale up and down within seconds to match the demands of any workload. 

**3. Faster time to market**:

Serverless applications reduce the operations dependencies on each development cycle, increasing development team's agility to deliver more functionality in less time. 

**4. More efficient use of resources**:

Shifting to serverless technologies helps organizations reduce TCO and reallocate resources to accelerate the pace of innovation. 
 
## Why an end-to-end serverless platform is important? 

 - A serverless approach offers developers, teams and organizations a level of abstraction that enables them to minimize the time and resources invested in infrastructure management. Every component of an application benefits from this approach, from computing and the database engine to messaging, analytics and artificial intelligence. 

 - Using an end-to-end serverless platform that provides a comprehensive set of serverless technologies is the best way to ensure that the organization gains the maximum benefit from going serverless.
