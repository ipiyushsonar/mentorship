# 1. Short preface of _Cloud Computing._

* Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. It goes back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic server's infrastructure of the Internet as nothing but a unstructured network accepting connections and giving out information as it floats. Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network.



# 2. Why We _Need Cloud Computing?_

* We Learned this topic with the example like we have one application for our organization and we have to run it fluently without any lag so basically many Problems may occur without cloud computing scenario like we have not enough space and RAM to run that application without any lag...so here is the cloud computing thing comes into the picture now we will use cloud server or machine to run that software and run it virtually on cloud server*



# 3. What is the use of _learning cloud computing?_

- Learn cloud computing so that you will be able to store,manage,process,share,collaborate data and information with high speech and accuracy.

- Learn Cloud Computing so that you can use it to grow your business.

- Learn Cloud Computing because it’s a latest technological change and we are the part of this change from local server computing to using the network of remote server.

- If you are a programmer and fresher in programming learn about cloud computing. It will help you to understand the new ways you can use to program,devlop,deploy and provide application access to the users.



# 4. _I am a programmer, I don't need to learn cloud computing?_

* Till now we learned many programming languages like c,c++, python but we just compile the code and run it thats it so our work finished but in industry level we need to deploy our code on cloud and we have think about time complexity , space complexity,etc because thousands of people are accessing code at same time thats why programmer also need to learn about Cloud Computing.



# 5. What is the _basic concept of GitHub?_


* GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
It connects the developers and coders from all over the world with each other to share knowledge and work together.




# 6. How we can _use GitHub_, and what are the _features of GitHub?_


* GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. It allows you to share your code and edit in others code. You can use this essential features provided by GitHub and perform a lot of task.

  > ## Features of github 
  
   - #### Development teams everywhere can work together to secure the software supply chain
   - #### Github simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects
   - #### Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files.
     ## ***Repository***
     - #### A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded
     ## ***Fork***
     - #### forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
     ## ***Star***
     - #### Users on the GitHub website are able to ***star*** other people's repositories, thereby saving them in their list of Starred Repos. Some people use ***stars*** to indicate that they like a project, other people use them as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
     ## ***Watch***
     - #### When you are watching a project or a person you will receive status updates on their activities. These activities include commits, tagging, repository creation etc.

>> ### 1. _Importance of technical documentation._
>> ### 2. _How to use GitHub Repository and how to pull request any information?_
>> ### 3. _What is markdown language?_



# 1. Importance of _technical documentation_.

* Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.



# 2. How to use _GitHub Repository_ and how to _pull request_ any information?

* _we can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility_

  * Pool Request is it tells owner and others about you have did some changes or added some data in repository and owner has access to approve or disapprove the pool request.



# 3. What is _markdown language?_

* Markup Language is used for annotate text and embed tags.  
For e.g - HTML(Hyper Text Mark-up Language)Whuch is used for web designing.  

* Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like "#" or "*".

Symbols like #,>,_ and many more are used to define a particular style or formatting. Html tags can also be used to insert list, tables, images etc.

> 1. _What is Capital expenditure (CapEx)?_
> 2. _What is Operational expenditure (OpEx)_
> 3. _Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)_

# _1. What is Capital expenditure (CapEx)?_

* Capital expenditures (CapEx) refer to funds that are used by a company for the purchase, improvement, or maintenance of long-term assets to improve the efficiency or capacity of the company. Long-term assets are usually physical, fixed and non-consumable assets such as property, equipment, or infrastructure, and that have a useful life of more than one accounting period.
<br> Capital expenditures include _the purchase of items such as new equipment, machinery, land, plant, buildings or warehouses, furniture and fixtures, business vehicles, software, or intangible assets such as a patent or license._
* ## Types of Capital expenditure (CapEx):
     There are two types of expenditure-
     * Expenses for the maintenance of levels of operation present within the company and 
     * Expenses that will enable an increase in future growth.
* ## Included in capital expenditures are amounts spent on:
     * acquiring fixed, and in some cases, intangible assets
     * repairing an existing asset so as to improve its useful life
     * upgrading an existing asset if it results in a superior fixture
     * preparing an asset to be used in business
     * restoring property or adapting it to a new or different use
     * starting or acquiring a new business
     
# _2. What is Operational expenditure (OpEx)_

* An operational expenditure (Opex) is the money a company spends on an ongoing, day-to-day basis in order to run a business or system. Depending upon the industry, these expenses can range from the ink used to print documents to the wages paid to employees.
<br> In brief, "operating expenses" include most expenditures for operating the firm's usual line of busines—expenditures that are not capital spending. Operating expenses do not result in capital assets. Instead, they serve entirely for—not surprisingly—"operating" the business. Accountants calculate "profits" by subtracting the period's expenses from the period's incoming revenues.
Operating expenses include:

* ## Operating expenses include:

  * accounting expenses
  * license fees
  * maintenance and repairs, such as snow removal, trash removal, janitorial service, pest control, and lawn care
  * advertising
  * office expenses
  * supplies
  * attorney fees and legal fees
  * utilities, such as telephone
  * insurance
  * property management
  * travel and vehicle expenses
  * leasing commissions
  * salary and wages
  
# _3. Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)_
### The key differences between both are:-

- [ ] Funds that fall under capital expenditures are for major purchases that will be used in the future. The life of these purchases extends beyond the current accounting period in which they were purchased. Because these costs can be recovered only over time through depreciation, companies usually prepare a capital expense budget apart from OPEX.

- [ ] Operating expenses represent the day-to-day expenses necessary to run a business. Because these are short-term costs that are used up in the same accounting period in which they were purchased, it makes sense for them to have a separate budget.

- [ ] CapEx cannot be fully deducted in the period when they were incurred. Tangible assets are depreciated and intangible assets are amortized over time. On the other hand. Operating expenses are fully deducted in the accounting period during which they were incurred.

- [ ] Money spent on inventory falls under capex. While the money spent turning inventory into throughput is opex.
- [ ] CapEx costs incurred for buying the income producing property.	OpEx costs associated with the operation and maintenance of an income producing property.

> 1. _What is Cloud deployment model?
> 2. _What are the different types of Cloud deployment models?_



# _1. What is Cloud deployment model?_

* A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access.
<br>  It is a configuration of environment parameters such as the accessibility and proprietorship of the deployment infrastructure and storage size. It means that deployment types vary depending on who controls the infrastructure and where it resides.

# _2. What are the different types of Cloud deployment models?_

* Depending upon the infrastructure, storage, and accessibility, there are 4 different types of cloud deployment models. They are:-
* ## 1. Public Cloud
     * As the name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers. 
The Server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage them and administer pool resources, which is why there is no need for user companies to buy and maintain their hardware.
The Provider companies offer resources as a service both free of charge or on a pay-per-use basis via the Internet connection. Users can scale resources as per there need.
     * _Advantages:-_ 
        - [ ] Hassle-free infrastructure management
        - [ ] High scalability
        - [ ] Reduced costs
        - [ ] 24/7 uptime
     * _Disadvantages:-_
        - [ ] Compromised reliability
        - [ ] Data security and privacy give rise to concern. 
        - [ ] The lack of a bespoke service. 
* ## 2. Private cloud
     * Only one organization uses this deployment model to run its workloads, and the server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the user company
There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar.
A private model is especially suitable for companies that seek to safeguard their mission-critical operations or for businesses with changing requirements.
     * Advantages:-
       - [ ] Bespoke and flexible development
       - [ ] High security, privacy and reliability
       - [ ] High scalability
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] Costly 
       - [ ] Requires considerable expenses on hardware, software and staff training.
* ## 3. Community cloud
     * In the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.
If the organizations have uniform security, privacy and performance requirements, this multi-tenant data center architecture helps companies achieve their business-specific objectives.
It is particularly suited for organizations that work on joint projects. In that case, a centralized cloud facilitates project development, management and implementation. Also, the costs are shared across all users.
     * Advantages:- 
       - [ ] Cost reduction
       - [ ] Improved security, privacy and reliability
       - [ ] Ease of data sharing and collaboration
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] High cost if compared to a public deployment model
       - [ ] Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity
* ## 4. Hybrid cloud 
     *  A hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above-mentioned deployment models — public, private and community ones. It allows companies to mix and match the facets of all three types that best suit their requirements.

     * Advantages:- 
       - [ ] Improved security and privacy
       - [ ] Enhanced scalability and flexibility
       - [ ] Reasonable price
     * Disadvantages:- 
       - [ ] The hybrid deployment model only makes sense if companies can split their data into mission-critical and non-sensitive.

> 1. _What is Cloud services?_
> 2. _What are the different types of cloud services?_ 



# _1. What is Cloud service?_

* Cloud service is any service made available to users on demand through the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
They are provided on demand and you have to pay only for the services you require. Thus, cloud services are dynamic and can be scale as per the requirement of users. As the cloud service provider supplies all necessary hardware and software components, so the company didn't need to take care of it, and appoint any staff to manage it. 
- [ ] Example of cloud services include:- 
   * Data storage 
   * Backup solutions 
   * Email services 
   * Hosting 
   * Database handling and processing 
   * Technical support 
   
# _2. What are the different types of cloud services?_ 

* Cloud computing services falls under three broad categories they are:-
  * _1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)_ 
  * _2. Platform as a service (PaaS)_
  * _3. Software as a service (SaaS)_
<br> Let's know more about them 

### 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

   * IaaS provides the basic building block for cloud IT. It gives access to networking, computer (virtual or dedicated) and data storage space. It is a pay-as-you-go service 
   
### 2. Platform as a service 

   * PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and software systems). It allows to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy systems involved.  
It is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without thinking about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

### 3. Software as a service (SaaS)

   * SaaS supplies you a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. Mostly, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to care about the service is maintanance or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You can just focus on the usage of particular software. 
With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching.
   * One other part of cloud service is Serverless computing- Like PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The setup, capacity planning and server management for you is done by the service provider. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, u can use a specific function only when a specific function or trigger occurs using different allocated resourses.
