# What is Azure Region Pairs?

- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, and this makes a regional pair except for Brazil South, which is paired with a region outside its geography.

- Among these regional pairs or Azure Region Pairs, only one paired region is updated at a time. The Azure Region pairs offer multiple benefits. These regional pairs are always located greater than 300 miles apart. These Azure Region pairs are directly connected and are far enough alone to be isolated from regional disasters so that the disaster affects only one region.
