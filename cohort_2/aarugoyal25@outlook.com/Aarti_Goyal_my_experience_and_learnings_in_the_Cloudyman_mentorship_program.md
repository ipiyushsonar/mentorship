# **Introduction To Github**

  GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control     changes to their code.

## What is Version Control?

- Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…


- At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.  

- Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.  

- With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.  

- Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official.

- All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.  

----------
## What is Git?

- Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  

- Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

## Then the following task was assigned by the speaker and a deadline was given by him to complete the task:

------
1. Create an account on https://outlook.live.com/ if not already done.
2. Create an account on https://github.com/ using the above-created email ID. 
3. Visit https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/ to follow this repository to stay up to date with the program updates and exercises.
4. Download Grammarly for Desktop from here https://download-editor.grammarly.com/windows/GrammarlySetup.exe and signup on it.

------

The speaker told to fork,star and watch the saifeemustafaq/mentorship repository.  

-----
## Fork in Git

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

------

## Star in Git

- Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your stars page.
- Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of GitHub's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has.

## Watch in Git

By enabling watch in git,notifications will be received by the owner for all the ongoing activities.

--------

## Date: May 28,2020
Today the speaker explained about pull requests in git.

## Pull Request In Git

A pull request is basically asking the person in charge of the branch to include your code. And it also helps that person see exactly what you’ve changed in the code.  
Once some changes made, you could submit that code back to a branch by making a pull request. 

------

Then the speaker assigned the next task.  

-------

**TASK 2**

1. Visit https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/mentorship/tree/master/cohort_2
2. Find your folder and open it
3. visit the file Name_Surname_my_experience_and_learnings_in_the_Cloudyman_mentorship_program.md
4. Click on the pencil icon (watch the video if you are unable to find it)
5. change the Name and Surname to your actual name and surname and leave the rest as it is
6. Add a few lines in the file below
7. Click on Propose file change
8. Click on Create pull request
9. Again click on Create pull request
10. That's it. I will approve the changes that you have made

The speaker explained about Markdown language.

**Markdown Language**

------

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.  

Markdown is used in following places:

- Git
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension

Following url was provided vy the speaker to learn basic syntax of markdown language.

# Introduction to Cloud Computing

-----

The speaker briefly introduced cloud computing with taking examples.  
He explained that how cloud computing can be merged with any field such as Data Science,IOT,AI,robotics etc.  

------

- Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the Cloud (Internet).  
- Cloud Computing provides an alternative to the on-premises datacentre. With an on-premises datacentre, we have to manage everything, such as purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization, installing the operating system, and any other required applications, setting up the network, configuring the firewall, and setting up storage for data. After doing all the set-up, we become responsible for maintaining it through its entire lifecycle.  
- But if we choose Cloud Computing, a cloud vendor is responsible for the hardware purchase and maintenance. They also provide a wide variety of software and platform as a service. We can take any required services on rent. The cloud computing services will be charged based on usage.  
- The cloud environment provides an easily accessible online portal that makes handy for the user to manage the compute, storage, network, and application resources. Some cloud service providers are in the following figure.
