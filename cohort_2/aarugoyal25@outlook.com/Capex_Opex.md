- ## CapEx(Capital Expenditure):

CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment. Some examples of IT items that fall under this category would be whole systems and servers, printers and scanners, or air conditioners and generators. You buy these items once and they benefit your business for many, many years. Maintenance of such items is also considered CapEx, as it extends their lifetime and usefulness.

## OpEx(Operating Expenditure):

OpEx is your operating costs, the expenses to run day-to-day business, like services and consumable items that get used up and are paid for according to use. This includes printer cartridges and paper, electricity, and even yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations. These things are necessary for your business’s success but are not considered major long-term investments like CapEx items.

## Capital Expenses(CapEx):

Under CapEx procurement, you make a significant upfront investment in order to acquire and maintain your critical IT assets. This comes with sunk costs that make it difficult to pivot as business requirements evolve and which can impede or kill other projects in need of funds.


> 
**Many organizations also overbuy, in order to handle peak demands, but often times this results in expensive excess capacity that lays dormant.**

However, if a CapEx asset’s useful life extends beyond a year, it can typically be paid for through depreciation. This allows for tax deductions as the purchase accumulates wear and tear. You also have full control of your resources without having to rely heavily on an outside provider.

## CapEx comes with many constraints, including, but not limited to:
* The physical space required for these assets,
* Their steady depreciation,
* The required – and often complex – technical setup, and
* Lengthy acquisition cycles.

## Examples of CapEx Projects:

* Building a server farm to host business applications
* Creating a Storage Area Network to host data across applications
* Investing in new network equipment to improve performance


**CapEx Expenses VS OpEx Expenses**

CapEx | OpEx
----- | -----
Purpose:Assets purchased with a useful life beyond current year | Purpose: Ongoing costs to run a business
When Paid: Up front | When Paid: Monthly or annual income
When Accounted for:Over 3-10 year lifespan while assests depricates | When Accounted for:In the current month or year
Listed As: Property or equivalent | Listed As:Operating Cost
Tax Treatment: Deducted over time as assets depricates | Tax Treatment: Deducted in the current tax year

## OpEx(Operating Expenses):

With OpEx, and technologies like public cloud, you gain much more flexibility than you would with CapEx:

- Its pay-as-you-go structure allows for predictable expenses, with capacity being scalable to current demand and allowing for future growth.
- Costs are based on consumption, meaning less risk of over provisioning. However, it’s important to use a solution that’s properly sized to actual demand and supported by automation, to avoid runaway spending.
- Projects are easier to pivot thanks to the availability of on-demand resources and the option to use bursting and elasticity to scale capacity up and down as your needs change.
- Line-of-business units can also take ownership of budgets that were once the exclusive purview of the IT department.

>**Keeping costs from spiraling out of control is essential when consuming OpEx services.**

Examples of OpEx expenditures include:

1. Public cloud consumption
2. Telecom service fees
3. Offsite backup/archival storage

The answer to **“Should I use a CapEx or OpEx model for my infrastructure?”** will always depend on the situation at hand. That said, as public cloud continues to gain popularity, so will OpEx.

It’s much easier to make pivotal decisions about your cloud environments and get the most from an OpEx deployment if you have a well-defined process for predicting your costs, along with the technical solutions for managing them.
