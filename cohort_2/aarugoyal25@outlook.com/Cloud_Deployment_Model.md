## Cloud Deployment Models

-------

There are 4 fundamental Deployment Models of cloud computing: Public Cloud, Private Cloud and Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud.

1. ## Public Cloud

- In Public Cloud model, services and infrastructure are hosted on premise of cloud provider and are provisioned for open use by general public. The end users can access the services via public network like internet. Public Cloud services are delivered mostly on demand. Popular for hosting everyday apps like email, CRM and other business support apps.
- Public Cloud model offers high scalability, automated maintenance but more vulnerable to attacks due to high levels of accessibility.
- Common Public Cloud providers include **Amazon Web Services** and **Microsoft Azure**.

----------

2. ## Private Cloud

- Private Cloud model provides cloud services and infrastructure exclusively to a single tenant. The tenant can control and customize it to his need. The cloud infrastructure can be monitored either by cloud provider or the tenant. 
- Many companies are migrating their data centers to Private Cloud to run core business fields like research, manufacturing human resource etc.
- The Private Cloud model offers great levels of security and control, though cost 
- Common Private Cloud providers include **VMware** and **Openstack**.

3. ## Hybrid Cloud

- As the name suggests Hybrid Cloud is composition of both Public Cloud and Private Cloud infrastructure. The company can use Private Cloud to run mission critical operations and Private Cloud to run non sensitive high demand operations.
- The companies using Hybrid Cloud model benefit with the security and control aspect of Private Cloud and off-hand management and cost benefits of Public Cloud.
- Non-critical tasks such as development and test workloads can be done using public cloud whereas critical tasks that are sensitive such as organization data handling are done using a private cloud. 
- Benefits of both deployment models, as well as a community deployment model, are possible in a hybrid cloud hosting. It can cross isolation and overcome boundaries by the provider; hence, it cannot be simply categorized into any of the three deployments - public, private or community cloud.

--------

4. ## Community Model

- Community Cloud is another type of cloud computing in which the setup of the cloud is shared manually among different organizations that belong to the same community or area. 
- Example of such a community is where organizations/firms are there along with the financial institutions/banks.
-  A multi-tenant setup developed using cloud among different organizations that belong to a particular community or group having similar computing concern.
- For joint business organizations, ventures, research organizations and tenders community cloud is the appropriate solution. Selection of the right type of cloud hosting is essential in this case. Thus, community-based cloud users need to know and analyze the business demand first.

## Advanatges of Public Cloud

- ## Cost Effective
Since public cloud shares same resources with large number of customers it turns out inexpensive.

- ## Reliability
The public cloud employs large number of resources from different locations. If any of the resources fails, public cloud can employ another one.

- ## Flexibility
The public cloud can smoothly integrate with private cloud, which gives customers a flexible approach.

- ## Location Independance
Public cloud services are delivered through Internet, ensuring location independence.

- ## Utility Style Costing
Public cloud is also based on pay-per-use model and resources are accessible whenever customer needs them.

- ## High Scalability
Cloud resources are made available on demand from a pool of resources, i.e., they can be scaled up or down according the requirement.


## Disadvantages of Public Cloud

- ## Low Security
In public cloud model, data is hosted off-site and resources are shared publicly, therefore does not ensure higher level of security.

- ## Less Customizable
It is comparatively less customizable than private cloud.

-------

## Advanatges of Private Cloud

- ## High Security and Privacy
Private cloud operations are not available to general public and resources are shared from distinct pool of resources. Therefore, it ensures high security and privacy.

- ## More Control
The private cloud has more control on its resources and hardware than public cloud because it is accessed only within an organization.

- ## Cost and Energy Efficiency
The private cloud resources are not as cost effective as resources in public clouds but they offer more efficiency than public cloud resources.

## Disadvantages of Private Cloud

- ## Restricted Area of Operation
The private cloud is only accessible locally and is very difficult to deploy globally.

- ## High Prices
Purchasing new hardware in order to fulfill the demand is a costly transaction.

- ## Limited Scalability
The private cloud can be scaled only within capacity of internal hosted resources.

## Advanatges of Hybrid Cloud

- ## Scalability
It offers features of both, the public cloud scalability and the private cloud scalability.

- ## Flexibility
It offers secure resources and scalable public resources.

- ## Security
The private cloud in hybrid cloud ensures higher degree of security.

## Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud

- ## Networking Issues
Networking becomes complex due to presence of private and public cloud.

- ## Infrastructure Dependency
The hybrid cloud model is dependent on internal IT infrastructure, therefore it is necessary to ensure redundancy across data centers.

## Advanatges of Community Cloud

- ## Cost Effective
Community cloud offers same advantages as that of private cloud at low cost.

- ## Sharing among Organization
Community cloud provides an infrastructure to share cloud resources and capabilities among several organizations.

- ## Security
The community cloud is comparatively more secure than the public cloud but less secured than the private cloud.

## Issues in Community Cloud

- Since all data is located at one place, one must be careful in storing data in community cloud because it might be accessible to others.
- It is also challenging to allocate responsibilities of governance, security and cost among organizations.
