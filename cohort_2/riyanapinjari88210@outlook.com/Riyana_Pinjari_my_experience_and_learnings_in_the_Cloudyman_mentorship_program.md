# 1.Introduction To cloud Computing

    Cloud computing consists of three distinct types of computing services delivered remotely to clients via the internet. Clients typically pay a monthly or annual service fee to providers, to gain access to systems that deliver software as a service, platforms as a service and infrastructure as a service to subscribers. Clients who subscribe to cloud computing services can reap a variety of benefits, depending on their particular business needs at a given point in time. The days of large capital investments in software and IT infrastructure are now a thing of the past for any enterprise that chooses to adopt the cloud computing model for procurement of IT services. 
    
# 2.How cloud works
    To understand the workings of a cloud system, it is easier to divide it into two sections: the front end and the back end. They are connected to each other through a network, usually the Internet. The front end is the side of the computer user or client. The back end is ‘the cloud’ section of the system. 
 The front end consists of the client’s computer or computer network. Also the application essential to access the cloud computing system. It is not necessary that all cloud computing systems have the same user interface. 
 On the back end of the cloud technology system, there are various computers, servers and data storage systems that make up the cloud. A cloud computing system could potentially include any computer program, from data processing to video games. Generally, each application will have its own dedicated server. 
 
# 3.Benifits of cloud computing
   #### **1. Reduced IT costs:**
   
  - The cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract.
  - you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff. 
#### **2. Scalability:**  

 - Your business can scale up or scale down your operation and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing flexibility as your needs change. 
 - Using the cloud frees up your time so you can get on with running your business. 
 
 #### **3. Business continuity:** 
 
 - Protecting your data and systems is an important part of business continuity planning. 
 - Whether you experience a natural disaster, power failure or other crisis, having your data stored in the cloud ensures it is backed up and protected in a secure and safe location. 
 
 #### **4. Flexibility of work practices:** 
 - Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). 
 - If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily. 
 
 # 4. Applications of cloud computing: 

 - **Online File storage:** 
 MediaFire, megaupload, hotfile, 4Shared, rapidshare, yourfilehost are such examples which are used to host files including documents, images, presentation, videos, etc. The interface is easy to use, and users can upload and download files from these sites. 
 
 - **Photo editing software:** 
 Picnik, Pixlr, etc. are popular free online photo editing software. This online software has features such as cropping of the image, resizing, rotation based on degrees, special effects, addition and editing features are also included in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) format.
 
 - **E-commerce software:** 
 Cloud based e-application allows users and e-business to respond quickly to market opportunities & challenges the modern e-commerce is facing. It became for business tycoons to focus on the usage of cloud computing without considering the time and effort involved in implementing a reliable solution.  
 
 - **Miscellaneous application:** 
 One of the 1st utilization of free SaaS applications is to check for the status of packages & items. Applications such as UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, etc. provide free tracking of packages online. Another application name - XE provides services online from foreign exchange tools.  
 
 - **Presentation software:** 
 Sliderocket is an online free application to create a presentation. It allows importing of Microsoft's PowerPoint presentations. Since it is a web-based cloud application, the presentations can be accessed from anywhere within the globe. 
 
 - **Word processing application:** 
 Writeboard is another online word processing and document editing application. It has a unique feature that multiple users can access the same document using this application, edit that document and save the document after editing, but the document will have different versions. But it doesn't allow importing the word files.

 >> 1. Introduction To Github 
 >> 2. How Github Works 
 >> 3. What's a repository? 
 >> 4. The Github Flow  
 
 # 1. Introduction to Github: 
 GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is built.  
 
 GitHub for $7.5 billion in June, 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans.  
 
 # 2. How Github Works: 
 GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.  
 
 # 3. What's a repository? 
 A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.  
 
 Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.  
 
# 4. The Github Flow: 
The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours. 
The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:  

> ## Create a branch:  
>Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.  

> ## Add commits: 
> Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.  

> ## Open a pull request: 
>Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.  

> ## Discuss and review code: 
>Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.  

> ## Merge: 
>Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.  

> ## Deploy: 
> Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.

## Markup and Markdown Language

> ## 1.Markup:

In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. example Html etc.

> ## 2.Markdwon:

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like "#" or "*".

## Disater Recovery

- Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.

- Cloud disaster recovery is primarily an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution that backs up designated system data on a remote offsite cloud server. It provides updated recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) in case of a disaster or system restore.

- Also known as cloud DR or cloud DRP.
