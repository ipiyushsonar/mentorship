# The role of cloud computing in IOT Revolution:
> The internet of Things is starting to transform daily tasks are completed. The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of everyday objects â€“ physical devices, vehicles, buildings etc. with embedded electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect, send and receive data.

> The IoT generates a vast amount of Big Data and this in turn puts a huge strain on Internet Infrastructure. As a result, this forces companies to find solutions to minimise the pressure and solve their problem of transferring large amounts of data. 
Cloud computing has entered the mainstream of information technology, providing scalability in delivery of enterprise applications and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Companies are now migrating their information operations to the cloud. Many cloud providers can allow for your data to be either transferred via your traditional internet 
connection or via a dedicated direct link. The benefit of a direct link into the cloud will ensure that your data is uncontended and that the traffic is not crossing the 
internet and the Quality of Service can be controlled. 

## Difference Between Cloud Computing and IOT:
Cloud computing in simple terms means accessing data and programs from a centralised pool of compute resource that can be ordered and consumed on demand. Typically clouds 
deployments are described in 3 different models; Public, Private or Hybrid. 

- Private Cloud Services is a secure cloud that only the specified organisation can access. The additional security offered by a private cloud model is ideal for any organisation, 
including enterprise, that needs to store and process private data or carry out sensitive tasks. For example, a private cloud service could be utilised by a financial company that
is required by regulation to store sensitive data internally and who will still want to benefit from some of the advantages of cloud computing within their business infrastructure,
such as on demand resource allocation.
- Public Cloud Service is like a Private cloud although the main differentiator is that resources used to process and store data can be shared with other organisations, and data 
transferred over a public network such as the internet. Third party providers will deliver cloud services over the internet and are normally charged by CPU cycles, storage, or 
bandwidth that they require.
- Hybrid Cloud is a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on premise, private cloud and third party public cloud services. With the hybrid cloud model, IT decision 
makers have more control over both the private and public components than using a pre-packaged public cloud platform.
> The internet of Things, meanwhile refers to the connection of devices other than the usual such as computers to the Internet. Cars, kitchen appliances and other sensors can be connected through the IoT. The IoT is an enabler for change. 
It enables systems and devices to be automated in a cost effective, intelligent manner supporting real-time control and monitoring. Having all the relevant information available 
(real time along with historical trend data) provides the ability to combine and process this data in an innovative manner resulting in more effective and efficient control or 
decision making.

## How Cloud Computing Complements IOT Initiatives:
Cloud computing and the IoT both serve to increase efficiency in everyday tasks and both have a complementary relationship.  The IoT generates massive amounts of data, and cloud
computing provides a pathway for this data to travel. 

Many Cloud providers charge on a pay per use model, which means that you only pay for the computer resources that you use and not more. Economies of scale is another way in which cloud providers can benefit smaller IoT start-ups and reduce overall costs to IoT companies. 

Another benefit of Cloud Computing for the IoT is that Cloud Computing enables better collaboration which is essential for developers today. By allowing developers to store and access data remotely, developers can access data immediately and work on projects without delay.

Finally by storing data in the Cloud, this enables IoT companies to change directly quickly and allocate resources in different areas. Big Data has emerged in the past couple of years and with such emergence the cloud has become the architecture of choice. Most companies find it feasible to access the massive quantities of Big Data via the cloud.
