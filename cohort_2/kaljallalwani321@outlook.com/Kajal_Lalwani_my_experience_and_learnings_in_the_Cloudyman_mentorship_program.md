# What is Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. 
- The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

- If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
