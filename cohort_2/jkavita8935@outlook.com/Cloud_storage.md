> # What is Cloud Storage :

## **Cloud storage is a digital storage solution which utilizes multiple servers to store data in logical pools. The organizations buy the storage capacity from the providers to store user, organization, or application data.**

> # Types of Cloud Storage :

  ### 1. Personal Cloud Storage 

 ### 2. Public Cloud Storage
 
 ### 3. Private Cloud Storage
 
 ### 4. Hybrid Cloud Storage


## 1. Personal Cloud Storage :

### **It is a subset of public cloud-storage that stores individual’s data in the cloud and provides the individual with access to the data from anywhere. It also provides data syncing and data sharing across multiple devices.**

 ### **Example of personal cloud-storage is Apple iCloud.**


## 2. Public Cloud Storage :

### **It is where the enterprise and storage service provider are separate and there aren’t any cloud resources stored in the enterprise’s data center. The cloud-storage provider fully manages enterprise’s public cloud storage.**


## 3. Private Cloud Storage :

 ### **The enterprise and cloud-storage provider are integrated in the enterprise’s data center. Private cloud storage helps in resolving the potential for security and performance concerns while still offering the advantages of cloud-storage.**


## 4. Hybrid Cloud Storage :

### **Hybrid cloud storage is a combination of public and private cloud storage where some critical data resides in the enterprise's private cloud while other data is stored and accessible from a public cloud storage provider.**

## File:

 -  **File-based storage is a simple, straightforward approach to data storage.**
 
 -  **Retro or not, file-based storage works well for organizing data in a hierarchical, simple, and accessible platform. The key to successful file-based storage is a documented nomenclature (naming) strategy and regular clean-up. Also known as shared filesystem, file storage is good for file sharing, archiving, and data protection.**
 
 -  **The architecture has its drawbacks, though; unlimited scalability means an unlimited number of files to comb through when searching for something you need.**
 
 
 ## Block : 
 
- **Primarily deployed in SAN (storage area network) architectures, block storage references the individual block of raw storage that is then filled with files of equal size.**
 
- **Block storage allows a server-based operating system to use the blocks as individual hard drives. Although it may be a little less straightforward, the system’s management of metadata enables more efficient storage, making block storage a high-performing system.**

- **Block storage is typically used for databases, email servers, and virtual machines.**



## Object :

-  **The new kid on the block , object-based storage is deployed to solve for unstructured data (videos, photos, audio, collaborative files, etc.). Basically, when data is big or shared, object storage works by storing data in containers or “buckets”. Collaborative software utilizes object storage because it works across multiple levels, from the device level to the interface.**

- **With the explosive growth of data highlighted in the news practically every day, it makes sense a new kind of storage that allows for greater flexibility and scalability would flourish. Object-storage’s reliance on REST APIs enables access to objects via HTTP, creating a greater ease of access for authentication, permissions, and properties.**


> # Cloud Storage Providers :

### **Consumers and businesses continue to reduce their need to rely on local storage by placing files and applications in the cloud. One has to choose a provider who will offer the maximum amount of low-cost storage and bandwidth, while still keeping your data safe.**

> ## Free Cloud Storage:

> # Benefits of using Storage in the cloud :


## 1. Cloud Storage Can Save Costs

- **Economies of scale. Cloud vendors buy a lot of storage and pass those savings onto customers. But it’s more than a low per-GB cost that provides savings. Moving to the cloud reduces the need to purchase hard disks, the enclosures that contain them, the RAID cards that power the data redundancy, the electricity that powers them, and the hardware warranty services that protect them.**

- **It also lowers management costs by reducing on-premise hardware and software management, simplifying monitoring, and reducing the need for extensive capacity planning. Instead, administrators can focus on other, more important, tasks.**

## 2. Data Redundancy and Replication :

 - **Data redundancy is included. Most cloud storage vendors keep multiple copies of your data even within a single “data center” and offer great object durability to reduce any likelihood of data loss. But for those looking for even more protection, geographic replication options can make multiple copies of your data across regions.** 
 
 - **Some offer geo replication as a storage class option, while others offer replication services that quickly move data between data centers. Your backups are well protected.**
 
 
 ## 3. Data Tiering for Cost Savings :

- **Many cloud storage vendors offer different storage classes / data tiers. Select based on how quickly and frequently you restore backups and how long you plan to keep your backups in storage. For backups that need quick and/or frequent restores, consider using the vendor’s hot storage as retrieval is fast and the most cost-effective. For long-term storage, consider moving data to archive storage.** 

- **Restores can be slower, and there might be additional costs to retrieve data, but the storage costs are considerably lower – especially if you plan to keep the backups for years.**


## 4. Regulatory Compliance :

- **Keeping your backups in the same region as where the data originates may be best for regulatory compliance. Many cloud vendors offer data centers options all around the globe. If you have a need to store your EU customer data in an EU data center, look for a cloud storage vendor that can accommodate. An added benefit is that moving data to cloud storage in the same region is best for performance.**

- **Even if you’re not bound by regulation, you may find the improved performance worthwhile.**


## 5. Ransomware/Malware Protection:

- **Ransomware is just bad. Unfortunately, it’s also in the news with great frequency. One of the more sinister ransomware attributes is that the malware will look beyond the locally infected computer to the network for shares that have documents and files to encrypt.** 

- **If you’re hit by ransomware or some other malware that is encrypting or destroying files, you might be happy that your cloud storage can help to protect against ransomware by offering some backup security advantages as it’s more difficult to access without proper authentication.**
