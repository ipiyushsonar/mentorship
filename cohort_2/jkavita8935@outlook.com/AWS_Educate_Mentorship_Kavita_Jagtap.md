## Easy to use

**AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing
application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS’s
application hosting platform.**


## Flexible

**AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need.
With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the
migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.**

## Cost-Effective

**You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For
more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.**

## Secure

**AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures.
For more information, see the AWS Security Center.**


## Scalable and high-performance

**Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s
massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.**


## Reliable

**With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s
multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade.**
