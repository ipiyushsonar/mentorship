 - Importance of Markdown language.  
 - Documentation in Markdown Language.  
 - Use of documentation in Making resume. 
 - Brif introduction about cloud computing.  
 
## 1.Importance of Markdown language.

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats.The Markdown editor helps you to perform basic editing capabilities: manage headings, apply formatting to text to make it bold or italic, and so on.
  
- Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or HTML.
  
## 2. Documentation in Markdown Language.

- Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
 
 ## 4. Use of documentation  in Making resume.

- Resumme generally based on Kaywords.Speaker gave some short introduction about use of such type of documentation in *resume*.
- Markdown is designed to be human-readable, so if you need a raw text version of your resume, no transformation is needed.
  Markdown has syntax for section headers, lists, tables and more, so you can add as much structure as you want to your resume.

 ## 3.introduction about cloud computing.
 
 > Speaker explained by understandable example.
 - cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet  to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
 
 - **Cloud Computing** is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network . Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment.
 
 - Speaker tought us why we use cloud computing, by giving examples like Data Science, IOT,Robotics etc. also how we merge cloud computing with our field.

  > # ***What is Vertual Machine and working of virtual machine***
  
  -  A virtual machine is a program on a computer that works like it is a separate computer inside the main computer. The program that controls virtual machines is called a  **hypervisor** and the computer that is running the virtual machine is called the host. The hypervisor controls how the virtual machine can access memory, hard drive space, and other resources on the host computer. Virtual machines can be created through software known as **virtualization software.**
  
 ### Reasons to run a virtual machine:
 
 - It is a simple way to run more than one operating system on the same computer.
 - A very powerful server can be split into several smaller virtual machines to use its resources better.
 - It can help with security. If the virtual machine is affected by a virus, the host operating system is unaffected.
 - A virtual machine can be completely emulated, such as Java. This lets a program run on different types of computer without having to    be converted into a code specific for it. They can communicate even though the programming languages are not the same.

>  # ***Types of Cloud Survices:***
 
 ## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
 
   - Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided      hardware that runs your application , storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an      instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
   
 ## Platform as a service (PaaS)
 
   - PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an      application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you        don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.
 ## Software as a service (SaaS)
 
  - SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version     of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics     CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.

  >  # ***SDD and SSD***
  
# Solid-State Drive (SSD) 

- Solid-State Drive (SSD) or Solid-State Disk (SSD), is a storage device that stores data on non-volatile memory. Solid-State means storage that doesn’t require moving parts. Unlike Hard Disk Drive (HDD), there are no moving parts to an SSD. Some advantages of SSD are faster access time, noiseless operation and low-er power consumption.
  
# software design description (SDD)

- IEEE 1016-1998, also known as the Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions, is an IEEE standard that specifies an organizational structure for a software design description (SDD). An SDD is a document used to specify system architecture and application design in a software related project.

> # ***Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)***

 ## Capital Expenditure (CapEx) :-

 - CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.
 
 ## Operational Expenditure (OpEx):-
 
 - OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.
  
### Benefits of cloud computing :

-  ***Cost Savings***

   - Perhaps, one of the most significant benefits of cloud computing is considerable savings in company's IT cost. Businesses, no matter what their type or size, by moving to cloud computing you can save substantial capital costs through reduction in spending on equipment, infrastructure and software.
   
- ***Security***

  - In the ever-increasing era of data breaches, a top cloud computing security solution has security protocols in place to protect sensitive information and transactions. This prevents a third party from eavesdropping or tampering with data being transmitted.
  
-  ***Flexibility***

   - Cloud computing offers businesses flexibility and scalability when it comes to computing needs: Flexibility. Cloud computing allows your employees to be more flexible – both in and out of the workplace. Employees can access files using web-enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops and notebooks.
 
 - ***Mobility***
   
   - Enterprise mobility shares a deep bond with cloud computing wherein business people and individuals prefer accessing hardware, software, applications, etc., hosted on the web rather than using their own hard drives and computing machines.
  
-  ***Insight***  

   - When cloud provider provisions fundamental computing resources such as networks, processing, and storage, it is understood that the consumer has hardly any control on underlying physical infrastructure of cloud. Consumer of these resources is able to control deployed applications, operating systems, storage and to networking components to some extent.
 
 -  ***Increased Collaboration*** 
 
    - The cloud has reached a place where it has become an integral part of our everyday work-lives. Based on its affordability and colossal effectiveness, modern entrepreneurs are using cloud services to build and run their small businesses, while working with people from different parts of the globe. In fact, collaborative work based on cloud technology has already proved its competency in bringing your most diverse teams together.

 ## ***Economies of scale***
 
  - Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale. This cost advantage is an important benefit in cloud computing.

 - Cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are large businesses leveraging the benefits of economies of scale. These providers can then pass the savings on to their customers.
 
  - These savings are apparent to end users in a number of ways, one of which is the ability to acquire hardware at a lower cost. Cloud providers can also make deals with local governments and utilities to get tax savings, lowering the price of power, cooling, and high-speed network connectivity between sites.  Cloud providers are then able to pass on these benefits to end users in the form of lower prices than what you could achieve on your own.

   ## ***Three deployment methods of cloud computing :***
   
#### 1. Public cloud
#### 2. Private cloud
#### 3. Hybrid  cloud

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSFCU2PQkUFig6DbgCdFY9mwjM57S8e6IQuEWaKo63vlUVtyxrW&usqp=CAU)
  
  ## ***Public cloud***
  
- This is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on    your cloud provider's hardware. In some cases, you can save additional costs by sharing computing resources with other cloud users.

- Businesses can use multiple public cloud providers of varying scale. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud provider.

 ### Advantages
 
 - High scalability/agility – you don't have to buy a new server in order to scale.
 - Pay-as-you-go pricing – you pay only for what you use, no CapEx costs.
 - You're not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware.
 - Minimal technical knowledge to set up and use - you can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads      are secure, safe, and highly available.
 
 ### Disadvantages
 
-  There may be specific security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud.
- There may be government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements which public clouds cannot meet.
- You don't own the hardware or services and cannot manage them as you may want to.
- Unique business requirements, such as having to maintain a legacy application might be hard to meet.

---

 ## ***Private cloud***

 - In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide.
  
 - A private cloud can provide cloud functionality to external customers as well, or to specific internal departments such as Accounting or Human Resources.
  
  ### Advantages
   
- You can ensure the configuration can support any scenario or legacy application.
- You have control (and responsibility) over security.
- Private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements.
 
 ### Disadvantages
 
- You have some initial CapEx costs and must purchase the hardware for startup and maintenance.
- Owning the equipment limits the agility - to scale you must buy, install, and setup new hardware.
- Private clouds require IT skills and expertise that's hard to come by.

---

 ## ***Hybrid cloud***

- A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location. For            example, you could host a website in the public cloud and link it to a highly secure database hosted in your private cloud .
- This is helpful when you have some things that cannot be put in the cloud, maybe for legal reasons. For example, you may have some       specific pieces of data that cannot be exposed publicly  which needs to be held in your private datacenter.

### Advantages

- You can keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date hardware or an out-of-date operating system.
- You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud.
- You can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources where it's cheaper, and then         supplement with your own equipment when it's not.
-You can use your own equipment to meet security, compliance, or legacy scenarios -where you need to completely control the environment.

### Disadvantages

- It can be more expensive than selecting one deployment model since it involves some CapEx cost up front.
- It can be more complicated to set up and manage.

# Service Level Agreement (SLA) :

### A cloud SLA (cloud service-level agreement) is an agreement between a cloud service provider and a customer that ensures a minimum level of service is maintained. It guarantees levels of reliability, availability and responsiveness to systems and applications, while also specifying who will govern when there is a service interruption.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*lELQbQu6IWXeIC6N.jpg)


#### A service-level agreement (SLA) defines the level of service you expect from a vendor. Usually, SLAs are between companies and external suppliers, but they may also be between two departments within a company.

#### service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its customers that documents what services the provider will offer and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet.

#### For example If I buy an AC from the dealer he will offer me his services like free maintenance for a certain period and replacement policy in case of any damage as well as defines me the standards company should meet.

# SLA Life Cycle

## 1. Discovering service provider phase 
 
  Discovering service provider phase involves choosing possible partner(s) to interact with from known registry list of providers which
  is located according to customer‟s needs.
  
## 2. Define SLA phase 

 Define SLA phase which includes a definition of services, parties, penalty policies and QoS parameters. In this phase, it is possible     to negotiate between parties to reach a mutual agreement.
 
## 3. Establish agreement phase

 Establish agreement phasein which an SLA template is established and filled in by specific agreement, and parties are starting to         commit to the agreement.

## 4. Monitor SLA violation phase

  Monitor SLA violation phase in which the provider‟s delivery performance is measured against to the contract.

## 5. Terminate SLA phase

 Terminate SLA phase in which SLA terminates due to timeout or any party‟s violation.

## 6. Enforce penalties for SLA violation

 Enforce penalties for SLA violation if there is any party violating contract terms, the corresponding penalty clauses are invoked and     executed.

> # Who needs a service-level agreement?

 - SLAs are thought to have originated with network service providers but are now widely used in a range of IT-related fields. Some examples of industries that establish SLAs include IT service providers and managed service providers, as well as cloud computing and internet service providers.

- Corporate IT organizations, particularly those who have embraced IT service management, enter SLAs with their in-house customers -- users in other departments within the enterprise. An IT department creates an SLA so that its services can be measured, justified and perhaps compared with those of outsourcing vendors.
 
> # What does the SLA actually cover ?

Exact metrics of a service level are different among providers. Additionally they are different for individual services acquired by the end customer. The SLA commonly defines the responsibilities of the service in regards to availability and performance. Some of the performance metrics include:

- Agreed service availability.

- Agreed service performance metrics.

- Agreed support availability.

- Agreed support performance metrics.

Clearly defining the service levels expected of the service provider helps both parties eliminate the grey areas often involved in the provision of services. The SLA defines the level of service expected. Within a service level agreement, it’s possible to include financial incentives for exceeding goals and penalties for failing to meet a certain level of service. Typically, telecommunication services are set with penalties for the provider in the event that they are outside the SLA agreed metrics.
 
 ### **Service level agreements are also defined at different levels which are mentioned below:**
 
 - Customer-based SLA
 
 - Service-based SLA
 
 - Multilevel SLA
 
 
 ## Customer-based service level agreements: 
 
 The service provider and customer formulate an SLA based on the services that will be provided. For instance, an IT service provider     may help your business with its payroll system or billing system. The SLA defines that relationship in detail.
 
 ## Service-based service level agreements: 
 
 All customers working with a service provider receive similar terms. If you have a mobile service provider (and who hasn’t?), it will indicate what services it routinely offers and what additional services are available to its clients as part of the package.
 
 ## Multi-level service level agreements: 
 
 A single SLA can be divided into levels that specify a series of customers using a single service.
 
- **Corporate-level SLA:**

Covering all the generic service level management issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile and so updates are less frequently required.

- **Customer-level SLA:**

covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.

- **Service-level SLA:**

covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.
 
 --- 
 
- ### **Service Level Agreements usually specify some parameters which are mentioned below:**
 
1. Availability of the Service (uptime) 

2. Latency or the response time 
 
3. Service components reliability 
 
4. Each party accountability 

5.  Warranties 

Service Level Agreements are like insurance policies in which the corporation has to pay as per the agreements if any casualty occurs. Microsoft publishes the Service Level Agreements linked with the Windows Azure Platform components, which is demonstrative of industry practice for cloud service vendors. Each individual component has its own Service Level Agreements. 

- ### **Below are two major Service Level Agreements (SLA) described:**

## 1.Windows Azure SLA –

  - Window Azure has different SLA’s for compute and storage. For compute, there is a guarantee that when a client deploys two or more role instances in separate fault and upgrade domains, client’s internet facing roles will have external connectivity minimum 99.95% of the time. Moreover, all of the role instances of the client are monitored and there is guarantee of detection 99.9% of the time when a role instance’s process is not runs and initiates properly.
 
 
## 2. SQL Azure SLA –

   - SQL Azure clients will have connectivity between the database and internet gateway of SQL Azure. SQL Azure will handle a “Monthly Availability” of 99.9% within a month. Monthly Availability Proportion for a particular tenant database is the ratio of the time the database was available to customers to the total time in a month. Time is measured in some intervals of minutes in a 30-day monthly cycle. Availability is always remunerated for a complete month. A portion of time is marked as unavailable if the customer’s attempts to connect to a database are denied by the SQL Azure gateway.

  - Service Level Agreements are based on the usage model. Frequently, cloud providers charge their pay-as-per-use resources at a premium and deploy standards Service Level Agreements only for that purpose. Clients can also subscribe at different levels that guarantees access to a particular amount of purchased resources. The Service Level Agreements (SLAs) attached to a subscription many times offer various terms and conditions. If client requires access to a particular level of resources, then the client need to subscribe to a service. A usage model may not deliver that level of access under peak load condition.
 

 > # ***Benefits of the SLA :***

- Protects both parties. When internal IT deploys a new application, they work closely with end users to make sure everything isworking. They track application success by emails and phone calls, and if there is a problem they get on the phone with the vendor to solve it. However, it doesn’t work like that with a business customer and their cloud provider. An SLA details expectations and reporting, so the customer knows exactly what to expect and what everyone’s responsibilities are.

- Guarantees service level objectives. The cloud provider agrees to the customer’s SLOs and can prove it reached them. If there is a problem, then there is a clear response and solution mechanism. This also protects the provider. If a customer saved money by agreeing to a 48-hour data recovery window for some of their applications, then the provider is entirely within its rights if it takes 47 hours.

- Quality of service. The customer does not have to guess or assume levels of service. They get frequent reports on the metrics that are meaningful to them. And if the cloud computing provider fails an agreement, then the customer has recourse via negotiated penalties. Although these penalties will not necessarily replace lost revenue, they can be excellent motivators when the cloud computing provider is paying $3,000 a day while a service is down.


> # ***SLAs features include:***

1. Specific details and scope of provided services, including priorities, responsibilities and guarantees

2.  Specific, expected and measurable services at minimum or target levels

3. Informal or legally binding

4. Descriptive tracking and reporting guidelines

5. Detailed problem management procedures

6. Detailed fees and expenses

7. Customer duties and responsibilities

8. Disaster recovery procedures

9. Agreement termination clauses
 
 > # ***Cloud uptime***
 
 - Uptime is the amount of time that a service is available and operational. Uptime is generally the most important metric for a 
 
   website, online service or web based provider and is expressed as a percentage such as '99.9%'. 
 
   **For example** - A 99.9% uptime equates to 43 minutes and 50 seconds of downtime.

 > # ***Cloud downtime***
 
- Cloud downtime is the amount of time that a cloud service hosted by a cloud provider are unavailable to end users. Reliability,         availability, recovery, and unavailability are related concepts. The unavailability is the proportion of a time-span that a system is   unavailable or offline. This is usually a result of the system failing to function because of an unplanned event, or because of         routine maintenance.

- The term is commonly applied to networks and servers. The common reasons for unplanned outages are system failures (such as a crash)     or communications failures.
