> ## Github
- Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects.

- Once you register on GitHub, you can connect with social network and build a strong profile.

#### _Repository_
- A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host.

#### _Pull request_
- Pull request tell the changes done in the file and request other contributors to view it as well as merge it with the master branch.

#### _Fork_
- Suppose, you need some code which is present in a public repository, under your repository and GitHub account. For this, we need to fork a repository.

> ## Cloud Computing  

- Cloud Computing is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and proces data rather than local servers.

#### _Compaines that provides cloud services :-_
- Amazon Web Services  
- Microsoft Azure  
- Alibaba Cloud  
- Google Cloud Platform  

#### _Benefits of cloud services :-_  
- Efficiency / cost reduction :- Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly, without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or maintenance.

- **Flexibility** :- Users can scale services to fit their needs, customize applications and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection.

- **Scalability** :- Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.

- **Competitive edge** :- Organizations can move more nimbly than competitors who must devote IT resources to managing infrastructure.

- **Security** :- Cloud storage providers implement baseline protections for their platforms and the data they process, such authentication, access control, and encryption. 

- **Mobility** :- Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. 

- **Disaster recovery** :- Data loss is a major concern for all organizations, along with data security. Storing your data in the cloud guarantees that data is always available, even if your equipment like laptops or PCs, is damaged.
